Ever. In the entire universe. She is hilarious and teaches in a lighthearted and fun way that is also very clear to understand. I instantly purchased this course as soon as I saw it was released because I know Angela delivers the highest quality educational content possible. 100% recommend this course (as well as every other course she's created). Thank you Angela for helping me as I make a career pivot into becoming a hybrid UX designer/mobile developer!\" - Jacob Pernell</p><p>\"Angela is my favorite Udemy professor for coding courses. Her methods for building onto the material so that you're never progressing too fast or too slow make for a really engaging learning experience. She's thorough in her explanations, and uses fun projects to discuss the material. I had started a couple other Flutter courses before finding this one, and I've progressed more in 24hrs than I did in a week with the other courses. Would love an advanced Flutter course from Angela to tackle once I'm done with this one!\" - Jerome Llouche</p><p><em>\"You will not find a better teacher than Angela. She does a wonderful job of encouraging you to learn swift the right way. I want to encourage everyone thinking about taking this class to get it,&nbsp;as it is the </em><strong><em>BEST programming class</em></strong><em> I've seen on anywhere and I've tried more than a few of them. If you are looking for an excellent swift programming course, stop there here because you have found it. You will learn Swift from the very beginning of programming all the way through making your own apps that you can upload to the App store.\" - Ian Hopjins</em></p><p><em>\"SO GOOD!!!&nbsp;</em><strong><em>Retention rate is incredible</em></strong><em> because Angela does a great job in explaining and teaching every aspect of what we are doing. Most of the other instructors on Udemy put code on the screen and pretend nothing happened. This course is amazing! 5/5\"</em> -&nbsp;Muhammad Ibrahim</p><p><em>\"Angela is a </em><strong><em>spectacular</em></strong><em> teacher!\"</em> -&nbsp;Marco Zanirato</p><p><em>\"This course was terrific. Only after taking a few more courses from others that I</em><strong><em> realized how good this course</em></strong><em> was. This course taught me more than I was expecting, it provided great instructions and a lot of hands-on tasks to drill-in the concept.\" -&nbsp;Marc</em></p><p><em>\"Best use of your money! I was a complete beginner but </em><strong><em>Angela made me a pro</em></strong><em> in weeks.\"</em> -&nbsp;Burak Tunçbilek</p><p><em>\"IT IS #1!!!!!!!!! Absolutely Amazing. The best iOS course i have ever taken. Angela explains everything the way it needs to be explained, so everything is easily understood. The concept of </em><strong><em>this course is built to make you learn, not just watch</em></strong><em> and repeat. Angela is highly educated and it is very much noticeable during the entire course. Again, it is fantastic. Thank you. Please create more courses!!!!!\"</em> -&nbsp;Eduard Khachian</p><p><strong>Are you trying to choose between all the different Flutter&nbsp;courses on Udemy? Take a look at what students on my course had to say about this:</strong></p><p><em>I have revamped my expectation for what a</em><strong><em> 5 star course </em></strong><em>should be for Udemy. Angela, you're awesome! I already rated the course as 5 stars early on (at about 20% completion), but after completing roughly 70% of the course, I can say this is my favourite Udemy course as of today. Brilliant course Angela!</em> - Alberto L</p><p><em>\"I took a lot of courses on Udemy and elsewhere and non of them were as clear and perfectly paced as this one! Angelas approach is really awesome, </em><strong><em>deep and clear</em></strong><em>.\" -&nbsp;Žan Fras</em></p><p><em>\"I have taken several iOS courses, so far this course had the </em><strong><em>best explanation </em></strong><em>on swift and xcode documentation. The lecturer is kinda humorous sometimes which make this course even more enjoyable.\" -&nbsp;Bryan Pukanda</em></p><p><em>\"I have taken lots of courses on udemy and elsewhere for self learning and i can tell you with all the honesty this is one course which </em><strong><em>i did not want it to end</em></strong><em>. It is like one of those movies that you wish keeps going. Whatever concepts are covered were covered very beautifully and made learning quite simple. I got so many answers to Why? in this course like how closures work and why they work that way... why delegates work that way. Thank you so much for this course.\" - Arun Lakhera</em></p><p><em>\"I compare this to another top iOS class on Udemy, but I think that this one beats it. The reason? Angela doesn't show you a plethora of material and then say that we will discuss this later, or say \"just do this. You will see why later.\" She goes into the </em><strong><em>reason for doing something</em></strong><em> before doing it.\"</em> &nbsp;-&nbsp;Clyde Addison</p><p><br></p><p><strong>REMEMBER… I'm so confident that you'll love this course that&nbsp;we're offering a FULL money back guarantee for&nbsp;30 days!

With over 742,000 students enrolled and over one hundred and seventy four thousand reviews (<strong>with</strong> <strong>tens of thousands of those 5-star)</strong> to date, these comprehensive java tutorials cover everything you’ll ever need. </p><p>Whether you want to:</p><p>- build the skills you need to get your first&nbsp;Java programming job</p><p>- move to a more senior software developer position</p><p>- pass the oracle java certification exam</p><p>- or just learn java to be able to create your own java apps (desktop or web based) quickly.<br></p><p>...this complete Java Masterclass is the course you need to do all of this, <em>and more.</em> </p><p><strong>Why would you choose to learn Java?</strong></p><p>The reality is that there is a lot of computer languages out there.&nbsp; It's in the hundreds.&nbsp; Why would you choose the Java language?</p><p>The number one reason is its popularity.&nbsp; According to many official websites that track the popularity of languages, Java is&nbsp; in the top 3 most popular languages worldwide in 2022. &nbsp; Popularity means more companies and their staff are using it, so there are more career opportunities available for you if you are skilled in the language.</p><p>The last thing you want to do is pick a language that is not in mainstream use. &nbsp;Java came out in the 1990s and is still very popular today and continually updated by the owners, Oracle, over 30 years later.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Are you aiming to get your first Java Programming job but struggling to find out what skills employers want</strong> and which course will give you those skills?<br><br>This course is designed to give you the Java skills you need to get a job as a Java developer.&nbsp; By the end of the course, you will understand Java extremely well and be able to build your own Java apps and be productive as a software developer. <br><br>Lots of students have been successful in getting their first job or promotion after going through the course.<br><br>Here is just one example of a student who lost her job and despite having never coded in her life previously, got a full-time software developer position in just a few months after starting this course.&nbsp; She didn't even complete the course!</p><p><br><strong>\"</strong>Three months ago I lost my job, came to a turning point in my life, and finally made the drastic decision to completely change course.&nbsp; &nbsp;I decided to switch career paths and go into coding. My husband found and gave me your Complete Java Masterclass at Udemy as a gift, and I wholeheartedly dove into it as a lifeline. Following your course has been absolutely enjoyable (still working on it, not yet finished), and has been a great way of keeping on course, dedicated and motivated.&nbsp; Yesterday, three months after starting the course, and honestly to my surprise, I received (and accepted!) a job offer as a full-time developer. I wanted to just drop you a line to say thank you for doing this work, for being such a dedicated teacher, and for putting all this knowledge available out there in such an approachable way. It has, literally, been life-changing. <strong> With gratitude,&nbsp; Laura\"</strong></p><p><br>The course is a whopping 100 hours long.&nbsp; <strong>Perhaps you have looked at the size of the course and are feeling a little overwhelmed at the prospect of finding time to complete it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe you are wondering if you need to go through it all?</strong></p><p>Firstly, Laura's story above shows that you do not have to complete the entire course - she was yet to complete the course when she accepted her developer job offer.</p><p>Secondly, the course is designed as a one-stop shop for Java.</p><p>The core java material you need to learn java development is covered in the first seven sections (around 14 hours in total).&nbsp; The&nbsp;Java Basics are covered in those sections. The rest of the course covers intermediate, advanced, and optional material you do not technically need to go through.<br><br>For example section 13 is a whopping 10 hours just by itself and is aimed at those students who want to build desktop applications with graphical user interfaces.&nbsp; JavaFX&nbsp;(which is the technology used in this section) is something that most java developers will rarely or never need to work on.&nbsp; So you could skip that section entirely.&nbsp; But if you are one of the few that need to build user interfaces, then the content is there and ready for you.&nbsp; &nbsp;And there are other sections you can completely avoid if you wish.</p><p>If you want to know absolutely everything about Java, then you can go through the entire course if you wish, but it's not necessary to do so if you are just looking to learn the essential information to get a java developer position.</p><p><strong>What version of Java should you learn?<br><br></strong>Generally speaking, you would want to learn the very latest version of a computer programming language, but <strong>that's not the case</strong> <strong>with Java.</strong></p><p>Oracle, the owner of Java release many versions of Java.&nbsp; Some are released and expire in six months, with no future updates or support. &nbsp;Other versions have long-term support, for many years.</p><p>You can probably see why learning a version of Java that has expired makes no sense, and is likely a waste of time.</p><p>A company using Java technology&nbsp;(big or small) is not going to use a version of Java that has no updates or support.&nbsp; They will stick to stable, well-supported versions of Java that get updates.</p><p>Right now, in December 2022, the version of Java that offers this long-term support&nbsp;(LTS) is Java 17 - It's being fully supported until at least 2029 and likely will be extended from there.</p><p>As such, you want to learn the version of Java that your future employer will use, and that's&nbsp;Java 17.</p><p>The course will also be updated in the future as new LTS versions are announced by Oracle.&nbsp; </p><p><strong>BOTTOM&nbsp;LINE:&nbsp;You will learn the RIGHT VERSION&nbsp;of JAVA in this course!&nbsp; Right meaning the right version to maximize your future Java potential with clients or Employers.</strong></p><p><br><strong>Will this course give me core java skills?</strong></p><p>Yes, it will.&nbsp; Core&nbsp;Java is the fundamental part of the Java JDK (the java development kit) that programmers need to learn to move onto other more advanced technologies.</p><p><strong>Why should you take this course?</strong><br><br>It's been a best-seller since its release on Udemy, you would be joining over 742,000 students who are already enrolled in the course.</p><p>There are well over 174,000 reviews left by students.&nbsp; It's rated as the best course to learn Java for beginners.<br><br><strong>What makes this course a bestseller? </strong></p><p>Like you, thousands of others were frustrated and fed up with fragmented Youtube tutorials or incomplete or outdated courses which assume you already know a bunch of stuff, as well as thick, college-like textbooks able to send even the most caffeine-fuelled coder to sleep. </p><p>Like you, they were tired of low-quality lessons, poorly explained topics, and confusing info presented in the wrong way. That’s why so many find success in this complete Java developer course. It’s designed with simplicity and seamless progression in mind through its content.<br><br>This course assumes <strong>no previous coding experience</strong> and takes you from absolute beginner core concepts, like showing you the free tools you need to download and install, to writing your very first Java program.&nbsp; You will learn the core java skills you need to become employable in around 14 hours, and if you choose to, can take advantage of all the additional content in the course. It's a one-stop shop to learn java. If you want to go beyond the core content you can do so at any time.</p><p><strong>Here’s just some of what you’ll learn</strong></p><p>(It’s okay if you don’t understand all this yet, you will in the course)</p><ul><li><p>All the essential Java keywords, operators, statements, and expressions needed to fully understand exactly what you’re coding and why - making programming easy to grasp and less frustrating</p></li><li><p>You will learn the answers to questions like What is a Java class, What is polymorphism and inheritance and to apply them to your java apps.</p></li><li><p>How to safely download and install all necessary coding tools with less time and no frustrating installations or setups</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Complete chapters on object-oriented programming and many aspects of the Java API (the protocols and tools for building applications) so you can code for all platforms and derestrict your program’s user base (and potential sales)</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>How to develop powerful Java applications using one of the most powerful Integrated Development Environments on the market, IntelliJ IDEA! - Meaning you can code functional programs easier. &nbsp;<strong>IntelliJ</strong> has both a <strong>FREE</strong> and&nbsp;PAID version, and you can use either in this course.</p></li></ul><p>(Don’t worry if you’re used to using Eclipse, NetBeans, or some other IDE. You’re free to use any IDE and still get the most out of this course)</p><ul><li><p>Learn Java to a sufficient level to be a be to transition to core Java technologies like Android development, the Spring framework, Java EE&nbsp;(Enterprise edition) in general as well as and other technologies. In order to progress to these technologies, you need to first learn core Java - the fundamental building blocks.&nbsp; That's what this course will help you to achieve.</p></li></ul><p><strong><em>“AP-what?”</em></strong></p><p>Don't worry if none of that made sense. I go into great detail explaining each and every core concept, programming term, and buzzwords you need to create your own Java programs.</p><p>This truly is Java for complete beginners. </p><p>By the end of this comprehensive course, you’ll master Java programming no matter what level of experience you’re at right now. You’ll understand what you are doing, and why you are doing it. This isn’t a recipe book, you’ll use your own creativity to make unique, intuitive programs. </p><p>Not only do these HD videos show you how to become a programmer in great detail, but this course includes a unique <strong>challenge feature</strong>. Each time a core concept is taught, a video presents a challenge for you to help you understand what you have just learned in a <em>real-world scenario.</em></p><p>You’ll go and complete the challenge on your own, then come back and see the answers which I then explain in detail in a video, allowing you to check your results and identify any areas you need to go back and work on.</p><p>This is a proven way to help you <em>understand</em> Java faster and ensure you reach your goal of becoming a Java Developer in record time. Remember doing those old past exam papers in high school or college? It’s the same concept, and it works. </p><p>As your instructor, I have close to&nbsp; <strong>40 years of experience</strong> as a software developer and teacher and have been using Java since the year 2000. Yes, over 22 years <em>(I’ve taught students younger than that)</em>. Meaning not only can I teach this content with great simplicity, but I can make it fun too!</p><p>It’s no surprise my previous students have amazing results...</p><p><strong>See what your fellow students have to say:</strong></p><p>\"This course was a guiding light in my \"Becoming a developer\" path from the first step. It helped me become a much more educated developer comparing to my friend who learned to code from trial/error. It's still a guide for me. every now and then I will come back to this course to learn something new or to improve what I've learned somewhere else. A BIG Thanks to \"Tim Buchalka\" my Master.\" - Sina Jz<br><br>\"I was an absolute beginner when I started this course, and now I can write some good small advanced clean codes.

I have learned more in one afternoon of videos from this class than I have in 4 weeks of a college class. Tim actually explains what things are and why they do what they do, as opposed to my college instructor that mainly said \"go make a program that does *whatever*\" and then I had to figure out a program that would meet those requirements but not actually learning why it worked.\" - Stacy Harris<br></p><p>It’s safe to say my students are thrilled with this course, and more importantly, their results, <em>and you can be too</em>…</p><p>This complete Java course will teach you everything you need to know in order to code awesome, profitable projects, <br><br><strong>Is the course updated?</strong></p><p>As mentioned above, yes.</p><p>It’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate. New, more powerful hardware and software are being released <em>every day</em>, meaning it’s crucial to stay on top with the latest knowledge.<br><br>A lot of other courses on Udemy get released once, and never get updated.&nbsp; Learning an older version of Java can be counterproductive - you could be learning the \"old way\" of doing things, rather than using current technology.<br><br>Make sure you check the last updated date on the page of any course you plan to buy - you will be shocked to see some have not been updated for years.&nbsp; <br><br>That’s why I’m always adding new, up-to-date content to this course at <strong>no extra charge</strong>. Buy this course once, and you’ll have lifetime access to it and any future updates (which are on the way as we speak). <br><br>And when I say updated, I also mean enhanced.&nbsp; With the recently released Java 17 update, a lot of the content has changed to actually include features included in Java 17.&nbsp; This is not just a \"rebadged\" update - the content is updated with new features of Java.&nbsp; Videos are actually re-recorded, etc.<br><br>With this complete Java Masterclass, you will always have updated, relevant content.</p><p><strong><em>What if I have questions?</em></strong></p><p>As if this course wasn’t complete enough, I offer <strong>full support</strong>, answering any questions you have <strong>7 days a week</strong> (whereas many instructors answer just once per week, <em>or not at all</em>). </p><p>This means you’ll never find yourself stuck on one lesson for days on end.

    "CourseName": "The Python Mega Course: Learn Python in 50 Days with 20 Apps",
    "description": "<p><strong>An updated modern course</strong></p><p>The course was updated in<strong> November 2022, </strong>entirely<strong>. </strong>The new content is a significant improvement to the old course, with a better course structure, more real-world apps, and using the latest version of Python and other recent programming tools. The course assumes you have never programmed before and teaches Python from zero. </p><p><strong>Multimodal learning</strong></p><p>This is the only course that follows a multimodal learning approach that offers students both a video course and an environment that simulates real-world programming activities similar to a real bootcamp. Students learn Python by building programs from scratch, adding new features to existing programs, improving existing features, fixing bugs, engaging in code experiments, learning programming tools that every programmer should know, deploying apps in the cloud, and engaging with other fellow students. Your skill set will build up progressively and strongly while you also build your programming portfolio to list and showcase all your Python projects. </p><p><strong>A course for absolute beginners</strong></p><p>This is the right course for you if you have never programmed before. This course covers every Python concept using real-world examples, so you understand both Python language and the logic behind programming. From the very basics to the very advanced features such as threading, everything is introduced in the context of a real-world app that you will build. That will make abstract programming concepts easy to understand.</p><p><strong>Instructor-led projects and independent student projects</strong></p><p>You will be building programs every day as your skills grow. Every day you will create programs led by your instructor, followed by projects you will code on your own to bulletproof your skills. Finally, you will be able to compare your code with that given by the instructor at the end of the day to fill in any gaps.</p><p><strong>Changing careers or building apps</strong></p><p>Whether you want to change your career to a Python programmer or turn an idea into a real app, this course has your back. You can take the entire course to become a programmer or pick the projects that interest you if you only want to build a particular app. You will also learn Git and GitHub so you can create a portfolio of 18 Python apps on your GitHub account to show to potential employers or friends. </p><p><strong>From data science to web development</strong></p><p>The course covers a wide range of applications, from rich data science web apps that analyze and visualize large amounts of data to building web applications using Python web frameworks such as Streamlit, Flask, and Django. Other aspects of Python, such as automating tedious tasks, are also covered, ranging from generating PDF invoices to automating emails. This course has it all.</p><p><strong>Learn on your schedule</strong></p><p>The curriculum encourages you to work on the course by studying 2-5 hours every day, but you can also do multiple-day modules during the weekend or whenever it suits you. In addition, you will have unlimited access to all the videos and practice activities. If you take this course seriously, this is better than a 10,000-dollar boot camp. </p><p><strong>Boosted focus</strong></p><p>Keeping yourself focused and motivated with online courses is hard, but not with this course. The course is designed around real-world projects and challenges to keep students interested throughout the entire course. This is a course that you will actually finish.</p><p><strong>Student Testimonies</strong></p><p><em>\"This new material is great. I am learning the material much better than in the old format. These features help: repetition of the concept from many approaches helps me learn the concept well; the program development approach in teaching the codes (functions, variable assignments) makes learning more natural and therefore more efficient; the quizzes and coding exercises are well thought out, they reinforce the lessons. Congratulations! I am glad I remained with your course. By the way, I finished an earlier course of yours and got my first certificate in Python. But this course is way way more effective.\"</em></p><p><br></p><p>\"<em>I'm giving this course five stars today because the November 2022 update, well complete overhaul, is massive and really brings the course to a new level. I completed about 70% of the old course, so I can say, the new update is great.</em></p><p><em>The self-study tasks are a nice addition and the projects are like what we'd be doing in the wild. So, we learn a bit and then do it ourselves (no peeking), which takes the course beyond a series of code-alongs.</em></p><p><em>It's nice to have GIT integration now, which is something I've never gone into that much.</em></p><p><em>The course is angled towards CLI and web apps, along with some data analysis, so don't expect a course on neural networks and machine learning, even though there is a section about computer vision and motion tracking.\"</em></p>",

And this course is designed to give you those core skills, fast.</p><p>This course is aimed at complete beginners who have never programmed before, as well as existing programmers who want to increase their career options by learning Python.</p><p>The fact is, Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world – Huge companies like Google use it in mission critical applications like Google Search.</p><p>And Python is the number one language choice for machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence. To get those high paying jobs you need an expert knowledge of Python, and that’s what you will get from this course.</p><p>By the end of the course you’ll be able to apply in confidence for Python programming jobs. And yes, this applies even if you have never programmed before. With the right skills which you will learn in this course, you can become employable and valuable in the eyes of future employers.</p><p>Here’s what a few students have told us about the course after going through it.</p><p>“I had very limited programming experience before I started this course, so I have really learned a lot from the first few sections. It has taken me from essentially zero programming skill to a level where I'm comfortable using Python to analyze data for my lab reports, and I'm not even halfway done the course yet. There are other courses out there which focus on data analysis, but those courses are usually targeted at people who already know how to program which is why I chose this course instead. “ – Christian DiMaria<br> <br>“I have been puttering through your Python course . In that time, though, and without finishing it yet I've been able to automate quite a bit at my work. I work in a school system and unifying data from our various student information systems can be incredibly frustrating, time consuming, and at times challenging. Using your course, I've learned enough to write applications that turn massive text files into dictionaries that get \"stitched\" together like a database and output to properly formatted CSV files and then uploaded via SFTP to various systems for secure processing. Our teachers, students, and the tech department have greatly benefitted from this automation. I just wanted to drop you a note thanking you for helping me learn this skill.” – Keith Medlin<br> <br>“This course was great. Within 3 weeks I was able to write my own database related applications.” – Theo Coenen<br> <br>And there are many more students who love the course – check out all the reviews for yourself.</p><p><strong>Will this course give you core python skills?</strong></p><p>Yes it will.&nbsp; There are a range of exciting opportunities for Python developers. All of them require a solid understanding of Python, and that’s what you will learn in this course.</p><p><strong>Will the course teach me data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence?</strong></p><p>No, it won’t do that – All of these topics are branches of Python programming.&nbsp; And all of them require a solid understanding of the Python language.</p><p>Nearly all courses on these topics assume that you understand Python, and without it you will quickly become lost and confused.</p><p>This course will give you that core, solid understanding of the Python programming language.</p><p>By the end of the course you will be ready to apply for Python programming positions as well as move on to specific areas of Python, as listed above. </p><p><strong>Why should you take this course?</strong></p><p>There are a lot of Python courses on Udemy – Your instructors, Tim and Jean-Paul are pretty unique in that between them they have around 70 years of professional programming experience.&nbsp; That’s more than a lifetime of skills you get to learn Python from.</p><p>You can enrol in the course safe in the knowledge that they are not just teachers, but professional programmers with real commercial programming experience, having worked with big companies like IBM, Mitsubishi, Fujitsu and Saab in the past.</p><p>As such you will not only be learning Python, but you will be learning industry best practices for Python programming that real employers demand.&nbsp; </p><p>And if that’s not enough take a read of some of the many reviews from happy students – there are around 100,000 students who have left around 19,000 reviews.</p><p>This is one of the most popular courses on Python programming on Udemy.</p><p><strong>Here’s just some of what you’ll learn</strong></p><p>(It’s okay if you don’t understand all this yet, you will in the course)</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the essential Python keywords, operators, statements, and expressions needed to fully understand exactly what you’re coding and why - making programming easy to grasp and less frustrating</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will learn the answers to questions like What is the Python For Loop, what is Python used for, how Python switch the traditional syntax of code, and more.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Complete chapters on object-oriented programming and many other aspects of Python, including tKInter (for building GUI Interfaces) and using databases with Python.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although this is primarily a Python 3 course, a python developer will need to work with Python 2 projects from time to time – We’ll show the difference in both versions to make sure you understand how things work differently in each version.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;How to develop powerful Python applications using one of the most powerful Integrated Development Environments on the market, IntelliJ IDEA! - Meaning you can code functional programs easier. &nbsp;<strong>IntelliJ</strong> has both a <strong>FREE</strong> and&nbsp;PAID version, and you can use either in this course.&nbsp; PyCharm will also work just fine.</p><p>(Don’t worry if you want to use another IDE. You’re free to use any IDE and still get the most out of this course).<br> <br><strong>Does the course get updated?</strong></p><p>It’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate. New, more powerful hardware and software are being released <em>every day</em>, meaning it’s crucial to stay on top with the latest knowledge.<br> <br> A lot of other courses on Udemy get released once, and never get updated.&nbsp; Learning from an outdated course and/or an outdated version of Python can be counter productive and even worse it could teach you the wrong way to do things.</p><p>For example if you apply some parts of Python 2 to Python 3 code, you will get completely different results.</p><p>We cover differences like this in the course and also continually update the course as well.</p><p><strong><em>What if you have questions?</em></strong></p><p>As if this course wasn’t complete enough, we offer <strong>full support</strong>, answering any questions you have <strong>7 days a week</strong> (whereas many instructors answer just once per week, <em>or not at all</em>). </p><p>This means you’ll never find yourself stuck on one lesson for days on end. With our hand-holding guidance, you’ll progress smoothly through this course without any major roadblocks. </p><p>That’s just one reason why Tim was voted <strong>top 10 in the&nbsp; Udemy instructor awards</strong> (out of a whopping 18,000 instructors), and quickly became a top-rated, bestselling instructor on the Udemy site. &nbsp;</p><p><em>Student Quote: “</em>Tim and JP are excellent teachers and are constantly answering questions and surveying students on new topics they will like to learn. This isn't a Python course it’s THE Python course you need.” – Sean Burger</p><p><strong><em>There’s no risk either!</em></strong></p><p>This course comes with a <strong>full 30 day money-back guarantee</strong>. Meaning if you are not completely satisfied with the course or your progress, simply let Tim or J-P know and they will refund you 100%, every last penny no questions asked.</p><p>You either end up with Python skills, go on to develop great programs and potentially make an awesome career for yourself, or you try the course and simply get all your money back if you don’t like it… </p><p><strong>You literally can’t lose.</strong> </p><p><strong>Ready to get started, developer?</strong></p><p><strong>Enrol now </strong>using the “Add to Cart” button on the right, and get started on your way to creative, advanced Python brilliance.

    "description": "<p>We all want to become better software developers and be able to call ourselves \"Software Engineers\" or \"Software Architects\", but to do that you first have to master a number of design patterns.</p><p>This course will put you on a track to that destination. </p><p>We will teach you how to recognize when to use specific design patterns to build complex systems in a divide-and-conquer manner so that complexity is reduced and abstracted.</p><p>But rather than learning all the design patterns out there, we have curated the <strong>most important, the top fundamental GoF Design Patterns for you. </strong></p><p><br></p><p>All of that in the context of the <strong>Flutter </strong>Framework using <strong>Dart</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>We start with full understanding of the <strong>S.O.L.I.D Design Principles </strong>and how they in turn relate to those design patterns. We eplain everything in the context of real-wprld problems as well as specific code examples.</p><p>At the end of the course you will get to Architect a solution by coding John Conway's <strong><em>Game of Life</em></strong> simulation which will run on your mobile device.</p><p><br></p><p>Complex software systems are plagued with three major issues:</p><ol><li><p>Timelines are stretched as requirements change.</p></li><li><p>Multiple developers have a hard time coordinating their efforts.</p></li><li><p>Code redundancy.<br></p></li></ol><p>This in turn creates issues with maintenance and overall flexibility for adding new features. In general this means poorly designed systems that are hard to maintain and are not adaptable.</p><p>One answer to all the above problems is having a <strong>proper design and architecture</strong>. Think of a skyscraper being built. <strong>There is always a high-level blueprint.</strong> This blueprint is used to show everybody involved (from architects to supply chain to construction workers to machinery scheduling etc…) what is being worked on.</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody understands and follows the same vision.</p><p><br></p><p>A blueprint has a number of commonly understood elements which repeat themselves across many projects. For example all buildings need electrical wiring and plumbing, they might need elevators, and cooling systems, and underground parking lots, and of course stairs. They also usually are connected to the electrical grid and water supply as well as… roads.</p><p>All these common elements follow certain standards that have been improved over many many years and across many many projects. They are well understood and can be used almost like recipes.</p><p>In Software Engineering we also have a set of elements that repeat themselves across many projects. For example all software applications need to create objects, they need to communicate state change across those objects, they need to be able traverse over collections of those objects. In other words, if you want to be a better developer then you need to become proficient in those elements that have been time-tested. <strong>In the Software Engineering world these elements are known as <em>“Design Patterns”</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>This course will teach students how to recognize when to use specific design patterns to build complex systems in a divide-and-conquer manner so that complexity is reduced and abstracted.</p><p>This will help you to design projects in an Architectural manner before any major development happens and can be used to shorten development time and reduce maintenance costs.</p><p><br></p><p>Design patterns are important because they are time-tested recipes or solutions to well-known software engineering problems. When creating software applications certain problems recur in a pretty predictable fashion so rather than ‘reinvent’ the wheel we will have an assortment of, if you will, wheels to choose from.</p><p>We will teach you this in a slightly different manner than you probably have been taught before. We will take a practical approach (i.e. specific examples) but the power of Design Patterns comes from their ‘concept’ and we will teach you the concept of those design patterns so that you are fully able to change them and modify them to your needs. In addition we will look at how to combine all those patterns into something greater: an architecture.</p><p><br></p><p>A well designed Architecture is this magical thing where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.<br></p><p>This is what we will strive to teach you.</p><p><br></p>",

Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson created Go to be a modern language that easily uses multiple cores, easily implements concurrency, easily works in distributed environments, and easily allows the programmer to write programs - it has a very lean and user-friendly syntax. </p><p>Go was created by <strong>luminaries in computer science</strong> at one of the best, if not the very best, software engineering firm to have ever existed - Google.</p><p>The credentials of Go are unsurpassed.</p><p>But why did Google create a new language?</p><p>In Google’s words, “Go was born out of frustration with existing languages and environments for systems programming. Programming had become too difficult and the choice of languages was partly to blame. One had to choose either efficient compilation, efficient execution, or ease of programming; all three were not available in the same mainstream language. Programmers who could were choosing ease over safety and efficiency by moving to dynamically typed languages such as Python and JavaScript rather than C++ or, to a lesser extent, Java. Go is an attempt to combine the ease of programming of an interpreted, dynamically typed language with the efficiency and safety of a statically typed, compiled language. It also aims to be modern, with support for networked and multicore computing. Finally, working with Go is intended to be fast: it should take at most a few seconds to build a large executable on a single computer. To meet these goals required addressing a number of linguistic issues: an expressive but lightweight type system; concurrency and garbage collection; rigid dependency specification; and so on. These cannot be addressed well by libraries or tools; a new language was called for.” </p><p>In my opinion, <strong>Go is the best programming language that you can be learning today.</strong> I began programming in 1982 with BASIC, I have worked with many languages, and Go is the best language which I have ever used. Go is also <strong>the top-paid programming language in America</strong> today.</p><p>Come learn about&nbsp;<strong>the greatest programming language&nbsp;ever created</strong>. You will leave with resources and code samples to start making all of your software and apps really go.</p>",

I instantly purchased this course as soon as I saw it was released because I know Angela delivers the highest quality educational content possible. 100% recommend this course (as well as every other course she's created). Thank you Angela for helping me as I make a career pivot into becoming a hybrid UX designer/mobile developer!\" - Jacob Pernell</p><p>\"Angela is my favorite Udemy professor for coding courses. Her methods for building onto the material so that you're never progressing too fast or too slow make for a really engaging learning experience. She's thorough in her explanations, and uses fun projects to discuss the material. I had started a couple other Flutter courses before finding this one, and I've progressed more in 24hrs than I did in a week with the other courses. Would love an advanced Flutter course from Angela to tackle once I'm done with this one!\" - Jerome Llouche</p><p><em>\"You will not find a better teacher than Angela. She does a wonderful job of encouraging you to learn swift the right way. I want to encourage everyone thinking about taking this class to get it,&nbsp;as it is the </em><strong><em>BEST programming class</em></strong><em> I've seen on anywhere and I've tried more than a few of them.

I was a complete beginner but </em><strong><em>Angela made me a pro</em></strong><em> in weeks.\"</em> -&nbsp;Burak Tunçbilek</p><p><em>\"IT IS #1!!!!!!!!! Absolutely Amazing. The best iOS course i have ever taken. Angela explains everything the way it needs to be explained, so everything is easily understood. The concept of </em><strong><em>this course is built to make you learn, not just watch</em></strong><em> and repeat. Angela is highly educated and it is very much noticeable during the entire course.

Angela, you're awesome! I already rated the course as 5 stars early on (at about 20% completion), but after completing roughly 70% of the course, I can say this is my favourite Udemy course as of today. Brilliant course Angela!</em> - Alberto L</p><p><em>\"I took a lot of courses on Udemy and elsewhere and non of them were as clear and perfectly paced as this one! Angelas approach is really awesome, </em><strong><em>deep and clear</em></strong><em>.\" -&nbsp;Žan Fras</em></p><p><em>\"I have taken several iOS courses, so far this course had the </em><strong><em>best explanation </em></strong><em>on swift and xcode documentation. The lecturer is kinda humorous sometimes which make this course even more enjoyable.\" -&nbsp;Bryan Pukanda</em></p><p><em>\"I have taken lots of courses on udemy and elsewhere for self learning and i can tell you with all the honesty this is one course which </em><strong><em>i did not want it to end</em></strong><em>. It is like one of those movies that you wish keeps going. Whatever concepts are covered were covered very beautifully and made learning quite simple. I got so many answers to Why? in this course like how closures work and why they work that way... why delegates work that way. Thank you so much for this course.\" - Arun Lakhera</em></p><p><em>\"I compare this to another top iOS class on Udemy, but I think that this one beats it. The reason? Angela doesn't show you a plethora of material and then say that we will discuss this later, or say \"just do this.

It's both a <strong>complete guide</strong>, starting with the core basics of the language, as well as an <strong>extensive reference</strong> of the JavaScript language and environment, ensuring that both newcomers as well as experienced JavaScript developers get a lot out of this course!</p><p>It's a <strong>huge course because it's packed with important knowledge</strong> and helpful content. From the core basics, over advanced concepts and JavaScript specialties, all the way up to expert topics like performance optimization and testing - this course has it all. My goal was to create your go-to resource for the JavaScript language, which you can not just use for learning it but also as a resource you can come back to and look up important topics.</p><p>The course is based on my experience as a long-term JavaScript developer as well as a teacher with <strong>more than 2,000,000 students </strong>on Udemy as well as on my YouTube channel Academind. It's<strong> packed with examples, demos, projects, assignments, quizzes</strong> and of course videos - all with the goal of giving you the best possible way of learning JavaScript.</p><p><strong>What's in the course?</strong></p><p>This course is obviously packed with content - I&nbsp;therefore strongly recommend that you check out the full course curriculum to get a clear idea of all the topics covered in the course. In general, here's what you'll find in the course:</p><ul><li><p>Modern JavaScript from the start:&nbsp;The JavaScript syntax changed over time - in this course, you'll learn the<strong> latest syntax from the start </strong>(you'll also learn about the old one though, so that you can work in ANY&nbsp;JS&nbsp;project)</p></li><li><p>ALL&nbsp;the Basics:&nbsp;Variables, constants, functions, how scripts are loaded etc</p></li><li><p>Arrays &amp;&nbsp;Objects:&nbsp;We'll explore these very important data structures in great detail</p></li><li><p>Control Structures:&nbsp;Understand how to run code conditionally and in loops</p></li><li><p>A&nbsp;look behind the Scenes: How JavaScript engines work behind the scenes and what that means for us</p></li><li><p><strong>Deep dives into Core Concepts</strong>:&nbsp;ALL&nbsp;the special things about JavaScript function, different syntaxes</p></li><li><p>Working with the DOM:&nbsp;How to manipulate web pages dynamically via JavaScript (including deep dives and different use-cases)</p></li><li><p>Events in JavaScript:&nbsp;Learn how to listen to a broad variety of events (e.g. drag &amp;&nbsp;drop) and execute appropriate code</p></li><li><p>Classes &amp;&nbsp;<strong>Object-oriented Programming</strong>:&nbsp;Learn how to work with classes, prototypes, the \"<strong>this</strong>\"&nbsp;keyword, constructor functions and much more</p></li><li><p><strong>Asynchronous</strong> and Synchronous Programming:&nbsp;We'll explore callbacks, promises, async/&nbsp;await and other important tools and language features to execute code correctly</p></li><li><p>Http Requests:&nbsp;Learn how to send Http requests via JavaScript</p></li><li><p>Tooling, Optimizations &amp;&nbsp;Browser Support:&nbsp;Code splitting, producing small code and ensuring that scripts work in all browsers&nbsp; - this matters and hence is covered in great detail</p></li><li><p>Libraries &amp;&nbsp;Frameworks:&nbsp;Learn about libraries like Axios or frameworks like <strong>React.js</strong> - why they matter and how to use them</p></li><li><p><strong>Node.js</strong>:&nbsp;Whilst focusing on the browser-side for the majority of the course (because the syntax is the same), we'll also have a dedicated section on Node.js to learn all about that JS host environment</p></li><li><p>Security &amp;&nbsp;Performance Optimizations:&nbsp;Of course security matters, so does performance - no surprise that both is covered in the course!</p></li><li><p><strong>Automated Testing</strong>:&nbsp;Testing manually is hard work and can be unreliable - in this course you'll also get an introduction into automated testing</p></li></ul><p><strong>What are the course prerequisites?</strong></p><ul><li><p>NO&nbsp;JavaScript knowledge is required - you'll learn it from scratch!</p></li><li><p>You also need NO&nbsp;programming experience other than basic web development knowledge (e.g. how the web works)</p></li><li><p>Basic HTML and CSS knowledge is recommended but not a must-have</p></li></ul>",

It starts with the Analytics Engineering Theory - all you need to know is to put dbt (Data Build Tool) in context and to have an understanding of how it fits into the modern data stack. We start with the big picture, then we go deeper and deeper. Once you learned about the pieces, we are going to shift to the technicalities - a practical section -, which will focus on putting together the dbt “puzzle”. The practical section will cover each and every single dbt feature present today through the construction of a complete, real-world project; Airbnb. This presents an opportunity for us to show you which features should be used at what stage in a given project, and you will see how dbt is used in the industry.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>RECENT&nbsp;UPDATES:</strong></p><p>Fully pastable course materials on GitHub and lecture notes added about common pitfalls in dbt setup - Jan 2023</p><p>Added Great Expectations and test debugging sections - Sep 2022</p><p>Radically simplified Windows installation instructions (no WSL&nbsp;needed anymore)&nbsp; - Sep 2022</p><p>The course is tested in dbt cloud - Aug 2022</p><p>Added Modern Data Stack overview - Jun 2022 </p><p><br></p><p><strong>THEORETICAL SECTION:</strong></p><p>Among several other topics, the theoretical section puts special emphasis on transferring knowledge in the following areas;</p><ul><li><p>Data-Maturity Model</p></li><li><p>Well-functioning Data Architectures</p></li><li><p>Data Warehouses, Data Lakes, and Data Lakehouses</p></li><li><p>ETL and ELT procedures and Data Transformations</p></li><li><p>Fundamentals of dbt (Data Build Tool)</p></li><li><p>Analytics Engineering</p></li><li><p>Modern Data Stack</p></li><li><p>Slowly Changing Dimensions</p></li><li><p>CTEs</p></li></ul><p>Once we understood the theoretical layer and how dbt fits into the picture, we are going to start building out a dbt project from scratch, just as you would do this in the real world.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>PRACTICAL SECTION:</strong></p><p>The practical section will go through a real-world Airbnb project where you will master the ins and outs of dbt! We put special focus on getting everyone up and ready before the technical deep dive, hence we will start off by setting up our Development Environment:</p><ul><li><p>MAC Development Environment Setup</p></li><li><p>WINDOWS Development Environment Setup</p></li><li><p>IDE dbt Extension Installation</p></li><li><p>Creation and Activation of Virtual Environments</p></li><li><p>Setting up Snowflake</p></li></ul><p>Once we are ready - among several other technical topics, the following features will be covered;</p><ul><li><p>dbt Models</p></li><li><p>dbt Materializations</p></li><li><p>dbt Tests</p></li><li><p>dbt Documentation</p></li><li><p>dbt Sources, Seeds, Snapshots</p></li><li><p>dbt Hooks and Operations</p></li><li><p>Jinja and Macros</p></li><li><p>dbt Packages</p></li><li><p>Analyses, Exposures</p></li><li><p>dbt Seeds</p></li><li><p>Data Visualization (Preset)</p></li><li><p>Working with Great Expectations (dbt-expectations)</p></li><li><p>Debugging tests in dbt</p></li></ul><p>Once the theory and the practical stages are finished, we are going to dive into the best practices and more advanced topics.

Every exercise is an unavoidable step in your studies. In the same way, don't start an exercise of a superior level without having completed the preceding ones: you will be in difficulty if you do so. Practice is the only way to learn and it cannot be taken lightly. We are going to be next to you along the journey and you have our absolute support!</p><p>When the Airbnb project is presented to you, you have to do it in its entirety, without omitting any guidelines and by understanding the objective. A project \"almost completely\" done is often a project \"totally incomplete\" for us. Give special attention to detail. Your only reliable source of information regarding the instructions is the pedagogical team, don't trust the \"I've heard\".</p><p>By the time you complete the course, you will be equipped with both a very solid theoretical understanding and practical expertise with dbt. All the fundamentals, dbt features, best practices, advanced techniques and more will be covered in our course, which will make you become a master in dbt. Are you ready? ;)</p><p><strong>How to get help?</strong></p><p>We just published our initial round of Discussions on Udemy which is the easiest and most efficient way for you to post questions, receive answers, and peruse questions from other students. If you have questions or feedback, please reach out to us!</p><p>That about wraps it up for us for now!</p><p><br>Once again, thank you for being a part of this course. </p><p><br></p><p>We can't wait to get started with you soon!</p><p>All the best,</p><p>Zoltan C.

On the other hand, we high level languages such as python or java script are more <strong>safer but are not very efficient from power </strong>and speed perspectives. <strong>With rust we have best of both the worlds</strong>. More specifically, it is a system programming language which means they have <strong>speed and control but at the same time</strong> are much much better because of the <strong>safety features</strong> just like high level languages. This makes rust so clearly standout among all the other programming languages.</p><p>Its popularity is increasing day by day and is therefore being adapted by bigger companies world wide. Google is also planning to use Rust in the Linux kernel, Microsoft, meanwhile, has turned to Rust to reduce memory-related bugs in Windows and Facebook has also forged closer ties with Rust, joining the Rust Foundation.

    "description": "<p>For a long time, web applications were usually a single application that handled everything—in other words, a <strong>monolithic</strong> application. This monolith handled user authentication, logging, sending email, and everything else. While this is still a popular (and useful) approach, today, many larger scale applications tend to break things up into <strong>microservices</strong>. Today, most large organizations are focused on building web applications using this approach, and with good reason.</p><p><strong>Microservices</strong>, also known as the microservice architecture, are an architectural style which structures an application as a loosely coupled collection of smaller applications. The microservice architecture allows for the rapid and reliable delivery of large, complex applications. Some of the most common features for a microservice are:<br></p><ul><li><p>it is maintainable and testable;</p></li><li><p>it is loosely coupled with other parts of the application;</p></li><li><p>it&nbsp; can deployed by itself;</p></li><li><p>it is organized around business capabilities;</p></li><li><p>it is often owned by a small team.</p></li></ul><p>In this course, we'll develop a number of small, self-contained, loosely coupled microservices that will will communicate with one another and a simple front-end application with a <strong>REST</strong> API, with <strong>RPC</strong>, over <strong>gRPC</strong>, and by sending and consuming messages using <strong>AMQP</strong>, the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol. The microservices we build will include the following functionality:<br></p><ul><li><p>A&nbsp;Front End service, that just displays web pages;</p></li><li><p>An Authentication service, with a Postgres database;</p></li><li><p>A Logging service, with a MongoDB database;</p></li><li><p>A Listener service, which receives messages from RabbitMQ and acts upon them;</p></li><li><p>A Broker service, which is an optional single point of entry into the microservice cluster;</p></li><li><p>A Mail service, which takes a JSON payload, converts into a formatted email, and send it out.</p></li></ul><p>All of these services will be written in Go, commonly referred to as Golang, a language which is particularly well suited to building distributed web applications.<br></p><p>We'll also learn how to deploy our distributed application to a <strong>Docker Swarm </strong>and<strong> Kubernetes</strong>, and how to scale up and down, as necessary, and to update individual microservices with little or no downtime.</p>",

The format will be a bit different than most other courses. Instead of jumping between unrelated concepts in every video and showing examples that have nothing to do with the real world use of the language, we will <strong>learn entirely through practice</strong>. </p><p>Together we will build real Rust applications and introduce new concepts when we need them to solve actual problems.</p><p><br></p><p>To start there will be a short theoretical section on low level memory management.</p><p>Then to introduce the basics of Rust we will build a simple command line application. This will provide us with the necessary knowledge to tackle a much larger project.</p><p>For our big project we will build a working HTTP server from scratch. We will write our custom implementation of the HTTP protocol and we will build a functioning web server with it.

Especially if you're going for a job interview or have a Java Project that needs your best performance. This course assumes no prior java experience so&nbsp;&nbsp;prior Java so&nbsp;it will take you from zero to hero!</p><p>The topics covered include Object Orientation which I think is not stressed enough in other Java courses so I've got special focus on that throughout the lectures. You'll get plenty of practice writing classes and interfaces as well as&nbsp;countless&nbsp;methods with loops and if else statements,<strong> exception handling and file processing</strong> as well as how to&nbsp;<strong>debug&nbsp;software using Eclipse</strong>. You'll also be mastering the <strong>collections framework</strong> and diving deep into <strong>java generics</strong>. You'll learn all there is to know about <strong>multi-threading</strong> and the <strong>JDBC API</strong> for working with a <strong>MySQL database</strong>. There are also<strong> practical projects</strong> scattered throughout the course so that you can practice the concepts as you learn them. For example one of the projects is related to a car dealership management system and another assignment involves processing files with stock market data. So as you can see, I tried to keep the projects professional and industry relevant rather than cloning a game like flappy bird.</p><p>I want this course to be the ultimate go-to resource for anyone that's looking to become a core Java programmer so I intend on adding more content to this course based on new technologies and student feedback. The content is Java 9 ready which means I'll show you how to upgrade to the latest version of Java which is version 9 and I'll teach you how to configure Eclipse to work with both Java 8 as well as version 9.<br></p><p><strong>Don’t just take it from me, take it from other students that have taken this course.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>★★★★★ <strong>Here’s reviews from real students that took this course</strong> ★★★★★</p><p><br></p><p>★★★★★ Instructions are very clear and easy to follow. <strong>I know nothing about java and so far I’m keeping up just fine.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>★★★★★ <strong>Easy to understand the difficult topics as well</strong>.

I signed up for this course to augment my university studies. I learn more from this one course with a better understanding of programming principles than I have learned at university.The university gives me college credit; <strong>this course will get me a job!</strong></p><p><br></p><p>★★★★★ I'm taking a class about object-oriented programming in relation to Java. However, the reading material uses quite a bit of technical lengthy jargon that I simply get confused. This class has been extremely helpful in presenting concepts in a straightforward and simple way. I can understand what he's explaining and it makes sense. <strong>This is a fantastic course and I'd recommend it to anyone who is feeling discouraged about learning about object-oriented programming</strong>.</p><p><br>★★★★★ Congratulations – <strong>the instructor has turned complicated topics into easy interactive components</strong>.

If you go to GitHub you will see that there are a huge number of active C++ repositories and C++ is also extremely active on stack overflow.</p><p>There are many, many leading software titles written entirely or partly in C++.&nbsp;These include the Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX operating systems!</p><p>Many of the Adobe products such as Photoshop and Illustrator, &nbsp;the MySQL and MongoDB database engines, and many many more are written in C++.</p><p>Leading tech companies use C++ for many of their products and internal research and development. These include Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, PayPal, Google, Facebook, Oracle, and many more.</p><p><strong>Can you see how learning C++ will open up more career opportunities for you?</strong></p><p>If more professional companies are using C++, it stands to reason that there is going to be more of a demand for C++ programmers.</p><p>But the main reason programmers should probably learn C++ &nbsp;is because it is so powerful!</p><p>What do I mean by powerful?</p><p><strong>C++ is&nbsp;super fast and&nbsp;is a general-purpose programming language that supports both procedure and object-oriented programming making it very flexible.</strong></p><p>It can scale easily. And it can be portable as well.</p><p>C++ can do many things that other languages just can't.</p><p>That's why nearly every major language has a way to interface with code written in C++.</p><p>Since C++ has influenced so many languages, if you know C++ you'll likely see elements from C++ in new languages you learn.</p><p><strong>How can a beginner learn C++?</strong><br><br>Find&nbsp;a good course, taught by an instructor with many years of experience in C++ is critical, as is the need for the instructor to have the necessary skills to be able to teach you the language.</p><p>Frank Mitropolous, the instructor in this course has been using C++ for over 2 decades and has taught students in both university courses and industry training courses. &nbsp;He even worked on a C++ compiler development project while he was in the industry.</p><p>So not&nbsp;only will you be learning C++ from an expert C++ programmer, but you'll also be taught by an instructor who has successfully taught&nbsp;at university level for many years.</p><p>As a result, you can take this course with confidence, knowing that you will learn C++ the right way, and in the shortest possible timeframe.</p><p><strong>Which version of C++ should I learn?</strong></p><p>C++ has had many version releases and updates over the years. &nbsp;It's a sad fact that most C++ courses do not teach Modern C++, but focus on old, obsolete versions of C++.</p><p>Frank teaches you Modern C++ (specifically C++ 14 and C++17). &nbsp;</p><p>Learn C++ the right way, with Modern C++, as taught by Frank in this course.</p><p><strong>What about C++20? Don't I need to learn about that as well?</strong></p><p>This course currently covers C++14 and C++17 but is still valid if you ultimately want to learn C++20.&nbsp; </p><p>C++20 is new and the reality is that C++20 compilers and tools are not yet ready for prime time and the industry is using mainly C++14.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So it's not really of any benefit for you to learn C++20 right now when the industry is not using it.&nbsp;</p><p>It's going to take many, many years for the industry to migrate to C++20 and that means jobs for C++20 are not going to be around for quite some time.<br><br>What is available right now, are tons of jobs for Modern C++ developers, and you will obtain those skills in this course. <br><br>It's our sincere advice to focus on learning Modern C++ and not get too hung up on the latest and greatest versions of C++.<br><br>And even if you really do want to learn C++20,&nbsp; the new features in C++20 are mostly advanced features that require understanding the foundations of Modern C++.<br><br>If you don't learn the basics, you won't master any version of C++.</p><p>Learning the foundations of Modern C++ should be your priority, which you will learn in this course!</p><p><strong>Is C++ difficult to learn?</strong></p><p>With all the power and flexibility of C++ comes complexity.</p><p>There is no question that C++ is one of the most complex programming languages out there.</p><p>But with the right instructor and the right training, you really can&nbsp;get up to speed with C++ quickly,&nbsp;and that's what this course is all about.</p><p><strong>What will I learn in this course?</strong></p><p>The course assumes no previous experience with C++ (or even programming in general), and you will end up with the skills to create your own programs in C++.</p><p>Key topics covered include.</p><p>* Looping with while, do/while for, range-based for statements and recursion<br>* Performing calculations and displaying results<br>* Functions<br>* Pointers<br>* Using existing classes and creating objects<br>* Creating your own classes<br>* Using Basic Standard Template Library classes such as Vector<br>* Constructors and Destructors<br>* Copy and Move semantics including Copy constructors, Move constructors, and copy and move assignment&nbsp;<br>* How to overload operators<br>* Using inheritance and class hierarchies<br>* Using Polymorphic functions and dynamic binding&nbsp;<br>* Using smart pointers<br>* Using stream I/O<br>* An introduction to the C++ STL<br>* An introduction to Exception Handling<br>* And much more.</p><p><br><strong>How is this C++ course different from other courses?<br><br></strong>You will learn Modern C++, for one. &nbsp;<strong>Many, perhaps most other courses on Udemy teach you old, obsolete versions of C++.</strong> &nbsp;If you are going to learn C++, it's imperative that you learn the Modern version to maximize your career opportunities and to ensure your skills are up to date.</p><p>The course format includes theory and concepts which are then reinforced with live code examples. Often the C++ debugger is used to step through code and analyze variables to better understand the behavior of C++. The instructor also uses a pen tablet to write on the screen and provide even more visual explanations.</p><p>You won't find better C++ training anywhere, and you will struggle to find someone with as much industry and training experience as&nbsp;your instructor Frank has.</p><p><strong>What do I get out of learning C++?</strong></p><p>More career options for one! &nbsp;C++ is one of the most popular programming languages used in games development. &nbsp; &nbsp;It's also heavily used in embedded applications. &nbsp;Your investment in time in learning C++ will reward you time and time again with more pay, and more opportunities, and frankly, more fun!</p><p><strong>Are you ready to get started?</strong></p><p>If you are ready to get that first paid programming job or to move up to a more senior programming position, then this course is for you! </p><p>Your new job or consulting opportunity&nbsp;awaits! &nbsp;\n</p><p>Why not get started today?</p><p>Click the&nbsp;<strong>Signup</strong>&nbsp;button to sign up for the course!</p>",

    "CourseName": "Working with Concurrency in Go (Golang)",
    "description": "<p>Go, often referred to as Golang, is well-known for making it remarkably easy to work with concurrency. In order to make a particular function run concurrently, all we have to do is prepend the word \"go\" to the function call, and it cheerfully runs in the background, as a GoRoutine. Go's built in scheduler takes are of making sure that a given GoRoutine runs when it should, and as efficiently as it can.</p><p>However, this does not mean that working with concurrency is simple in Go—thread safe programming takes careful planning, and most importantly it requires that developers have an absolutely solid understanding of how Go deals with concurrency.</p><p>In the standard library, Go offers us several ways of dealing with concurrently running parts of our program, right in the standard library:&nbsp;<strong>sync.WaitGroup</strong>, which lets us wait for tasks to finish; <strong>sync.Mutex</strong>, which allows us to lock and unlock resources, so that no two GoRoutines can access the same memory location at the same time; and finally, <strong>Channels</strong>, which allow GoRoutines to send and receive data to and from each other.</p><p>Go's approach to concurrency is fairly straightforward, and is more or less summed up this mantra:&nbsp;<strong>Don't communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating.</strong> Channels are the means by which we usually share memory by communicating. </p><p>In this course, we'll cover the use of WaitGroups, Mutexes, and Channels, and we'll do so in detail. We'll also cover some of the problems inherent in concurrency, including early program termination and race conditions. Initially, we'll gain a good understanding of how these things work by solving some of the classic problems found in the field of computer science, including the <strong>Dining Philosophers</strong>, the <strong>Producer/Consumer</strong> problem, and the <strong>Sleeping Barber</strong>. These problems are classics for a reason:&nbsp;they force a developer to figure out the best approach to working with code that run concurrently, or in parallel. </p><p>Finally, we'll finish the course out with a more \"real-world\" problem, where we have to register a customer for some kind of subscription service, and take care of invoicing, registration, and all the things necessary to get a new customer up and running. We'll do so, naturally, as quickly as we can by dividing the necessary tasks up into smaller tasks, and having them run concurrently.</p>",

We are going to use Python to work with Email, Text Messages, CSV files, PDF files, Image Files, Data Visualizations, build our own machine learning model and perform Image detection. We are going to build a web scraper for HackerNews, build a Twitter bot,&nbsp; build the most secure password checker and we will also build some automation tools using Selenium. But the best part? We will build an actual portfolio website using Python that your future employer and customers can contact you at. By the end, you will have a stack of projects you have built that you can show off to others.</p><p><br></p><p>Here’s the truth: Most courses teach you Python and do just that. They show you how to get started. But the thing is you don’t know where to go from there or how to build your own projects. </p><p><br></p><p>Whether you are new to programming, or want to level up your Python skills, or are coming from a different programming language, this course is for you. This course is not about making you just code along without understanding the principles so that when you are done with the course you don’t know what to do other than watch another tutorial. No! <strong>This course will push you and challenge you to go from an absolute beginner with no coding experience to someone that can go off, forget about me, and build their own applications and get hired.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Taught By:</strong></p><p>Andrei&nbsp;Neagoie is the instructor of the <strong>highest rated Development courses on Udemy as well as&nbsp;one of the fastest&nbsp;growing.&nbsp;</strong>His graduates have&nbsp;moved&nbsp;on to work for&nbsp;some of the biggest tech&nbsp;companies around the world like Apple, Google, Amazon, JP Morgan, IBM, UNIQLO etc...&nbsp;He&nbsp;has&nbsp;been working as a senior software developer in&nbsp;Silicon Valley and Toronto for many years,&nbsp;and&nbsp;is now taking all that he has learned,&nbsp;to teach&nbsp;programming skills and&nbsp;to help you&nbsp;discover the amazing career opportunities that being a developer allows in&nbsp;life.&nbsp;</p><p>Having been&nbsp;a self taught programmer,&nbsp;he understands that there is an&nbsp;overwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and books&nbsp;that are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper skills.&nbsp;Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp.&nbsp;<strong>Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education material&nbsp;should teach real life skills that are current and&nbsp;they should not waste a student's valuable time.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Having learned important&nbsp;lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even&nbsp;founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to&nbsp;teaching others valuable&nbsp;software development skills&nbsp;in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained.&nbsp;<strong>He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Taking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p><strong>See you inside the course!</strong></p>",

    "description": "<p>In this course, you will learn step-by-step how to design, develop and deploy a backend web service from scratch. I believe the best way to learn programming is to build a real application. Therefore, throughout the course, you will learn how to build a backend web service for a simple bank. It will provide APIs for the frontend to do the following things:</p><ul><li><p>Create and manage bank accounts.</p></li><li><p>Record all balance changes to each of the accounts.</p></li><li><p>Perform a money transfer between 2 accounts.</p></li></ul><p>The programming language we will use to develop the service is Golang, but the course is not just about coding in Go. You will learn a lot of different topics regarding backend web development. They are presented in 5 sections: </p><ol><li><p>In the 1st section, you will learn deeply about how to design the database, generate codes to talk to the DB in a consistent and reliable way using transactions, understand the DB&nbsp;isolation levels, and how to use it correctly in production. Besides the database, you will also learn how to use docker for local development, how to use Git to manage your codes, and how to use GitHub Action to run unit tests automatically.</p></li><li><p>In the 2nd section, you will learn how to build a set of RESTful HTTP&nbsp;APIs&nbsp;using Gin - one of the most popular Golang frameworks for building web services. This includes everything from loading app configs, mocking DB for more robust unit tests, handling errors, authenticating users, and securing the APIs with JWT and PASETO&nbsp;access tokens.&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>In the 3rd section, you will learn how to build your app with Docker and deploy it to a production Kubernetes cluster on AWS. The lectures are very detailed with a step-by-step guide, from how to build a minimal docker image, set up a free-tier AWS account, create a production database, store and retrieve production secrets, create a Kubernetes cluster with EKS, use GitHub Action to automatically build and deploy the image to the EKS cluster, buy a domain name and route the traffics to the service, secure the connection with HTTPS and auto-renew TLS certificate from Let's Encrypt.</p></li><li><p>In the 4th section, we will discuss several advanced backend topics such as managing user sessions, building gRPC APIs, using gRPC gateway to serve both gRPC and HTTP requests at the same time, embedding Swagger documentation as part of the backend service, partially updating a record using optional parameters, and writing structured logger HTTP&nbsp;middlewares and gRPC interceptors.</p></li><li><p>Then the 5th section will introduce you to asynchronous processing in Golang using background workers and Redis as its message queue, and how to gracefully shut down the server to protect your processing resources. As this part is still a work in progress, we will keep making and uploading new videos about new topics in the future, such as: sending emails, gracefully shutting down servers, CORS, bulk inserts, etc. So please come back here to check them out from time to time.</p></li></ol><p>This course is designed with a lot of details, so that everyone, even those with very little programming experience can understand and do it by themselves. I firmly believe that after the course, you will be able to work much more confidently and effectively on your projects.</p>",

Flutter was originally launched with support for iOS and Android. Flutter 2 was launched as a stable release in March 2021, with support for Windows, macOS, Linux, and web. Flutter runs with Dart, a programming language developed by Google. Dart is a strongly-typed, object-oriented language with a familiar C-style syntax. Developers can compile Dart programs into fast native code that runs smoothly on all supported platforms. On the web, Dart is compiled to JavaScript code that can run on the browser. Flutter is composed of three architectural layers: the Flutter framework, which is written in Dart and provides all the widgets that developers use to build their apps; the Flutter Engine, written in C++, which provides low-level rendering support with Google’s Skia; and the platform-specific Embedder, which talks directly to the operating system.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why did Google create Flutter?</strong></p><p>Flutter, first known as “Sky”, was announced in 2015 with Android support only. It was created to provide a better mobile experience for users and developers, taking the best parts of the web development experience, and bringing them to mobile. Its main goals were high-performance and portability across multiple platforms. While other cross-platform solutions such as React Native and Xamarin were already popular, they could not deliver the same fidelity and performance as apps built with the native iOS and Android SDKs. Flutter changed that by making it possible to create beautiful, performant apps across multiple platforms with a single codebase.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Is Flutter in demand?</strong></p><p>Flutter has been a production-ready, stable product on iOS and Android since its official launch in December 2018. Big companies such as eBay, BMW, Alibaba, and Toyota are using Flutter as the core framework for their mobile app development strategy. Over a hundred thousand Flutter apps have already been published on the App Store and Play Store. After overtaking React Native in Google Search trends, Flutter is now the fastest growing software project on GitHub. By choosing Flutter, companies can deliver mobile apps in record-time as they no longer have to build separate apps to support iOS and Android. This makes Flutter an ideal choice for startups, agencies, and small businesses, and as a result, the job market for Flutter developers is also expanding rapidly.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Is Flutter a programming language?</strong></p><p><strong>Flutter is not a language</strong>, rather an SDK just like Android SDK. For android development Java/Kotlin are the programming languages, for cross-platform development using flutter, DART is the official programming language.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Is Flutter a frontend or backend?</strong></p><p><strong>Flutter</strong> is a popular <strong>frontend </strong>development framework from Google that enables developers to build beautiful frontends for any screen. Flutter is designed to streamline cross-platform app development while maintaining a consistent user experience.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Which language is used for Flutter?</strong></p><p>Flutter apps are written in the <strong>Dart language</strong> and make use of many of the language's more advanced features. While writing and debugging an application, Flutter runs in the Dart virtual machine, which features a just-in-time execution engine.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Is Flutter a framework?</strong></p><p><strong>Flutter is an open source framework by Google</strong> for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is Dart and why does Flutter use it?</strong></p><p>Flutter uses Dart as <strong>Dart allows Flutter to avoid the need for a separate declarative layout language like JSX and XML</strong>. The layout of Dart is declarative and programmatic and it makes it easy for developers to read and visualize it very easily and effortlessly.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Is Flutter written in Dart?</strong></p><p><strong>Flutter apps are written in the Dart language</strong> and make use of many of the language's more advanced features.

Alibaba made a shopping app called Xianyu, which has more than 50MM downloads and more than 10MM active users every day. Nubank is the largest independent digital bank outside Asia, and its mobile apps are built with Flutter. Another shopping app is HuYu, which rewards users with gift cards and vouchers for sharing shopping receipts. You can also find music apps for recording and learning to read music. The Hamilton Musical and the famous Abby Road Studios created apps with Flutter. There are apps for sports, finance, fitness, education, animal adoption, mapped gas stations to compare prices, and a travel app. A Google Ads app helps mobile app customers track their ads.

    "description": "<p><strong>React</strong> and <strong>Go</strong> are something of a match made in heaven. React is the world's most popular JavaScript library for building Single Page Applications, and Go is uniquely well-suited for building REST back ends. That is what this course is all about.</p><p>This course has been completely re-done, for <strong>React version 18 and React Router version 6</strong>. The old version of this course is still available at the end of the new one, with each section marked as \"Legacy.\"&nbsp;I'll remove it in a month or so, just to give people who have already started a chance to finish that version, if they so desire.</p><p>Learn how to develop and deploy a fast, secure web application built using the most popular and in-demand JavaScript front end (React), with one of the most popular and powerful programming languages for the back end (Go).</p><p>React is an open-source, front end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. React is maintained by Facebook and a community of developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. React is the most popular front-end JavaScript library in the field of web development, and is used by many well-known organizations, including Netflix, Instagram, and the New York Times. With React, we build fast, interactive user interfaces.</p><p>Go is a modern, type safe, compiled, and extremely fast programming language. It it is ideally suited for building safe, scalable, incredibly fast REST APIs and web applications, and is also used by large corporations around the wold, including Netflix, Instagram, American Express, and the New York Times.</p><p>If you were paying attention, you might have noticed some overlap there -- the same large companies using React are also using Go. There is a reason for that, and we will be exploring that reason in this course.</p><p>In this course we will go over the core fundamentals of React, including the React life cycle, components, functional components, props, state, and more. We will also cover calling a remote API&nbsp;(both one we build, and a 3rd party API), and much more.</p><p>In the first part of the course, we'll build a simple application using both <strong>React class component </strong>and<strong> Functional Components</strong> <strong>with</strong> <strong>hooks</strong>. Although hooks and functions appear to the the future for React, there are literally millions of lines of code out there built using classes, so it's important to know how to work with React using both classes and functions &amp;&nbsp;hooks.</p><p>In the second project for this course, we'll build a Single Page Web Application (SPA)&nbsp;with a React front end and a Go back end API, where we will&nbsp; cover receiving requests on the back end, both as JSON and as GraphQL, and returning that response as JSON. </p><p>In order to secure access to authenticated users for certain parts&nbsp; of our site, we will also explore how to generate and use JSON&nbsp;Web Tokens (JWT), including <strong>refresh tokens</strong>.</p><p>This course is <strong>not intended for absolute beginners</strong>. I&nbsp;expect that you have some experience in JavaScript and Go, and a good knowledge of HTML.</p>",

Flutter can integrate with existing iOS and Android code bases. It's free and open-source.</p><p><strong>Flutter</strong> is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop cross platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase</p><p><strong>Dart</strong> is a client-optimized language for developing fast apps on any platform. Its goal is to offer the most productive programming language for multi-platform development, paired with a flexible execution runtime platform for app frameworks.</p><p>Languages are defined by their <em>technical envelope</em> — the choices made during development that shape the capabilities and strengths of a language. Dart is designed for a technical envelope that is particularly suited to client development, prioritizing both development (sub-second stateful hot reload) and high-quality production experiences across a wide variety of compilation targets (web, mobile, and desktop).</p><p>Dart also forms the foundation of Flutter. Dart provides the language and runtimes that power Flutter apps, but Dart also supports many core developer tasks like formatting, analyzing, and testing code.<strong><br></strong></p><p>The <strong>Dart language</strong> is type safe; it uses static type checking to ensure that a variable’s value <em>always</em> matches the variable’s static type. Sometimes, this is referred to as sound typing. Although types are mandatory, type annotations are optional because of type inference. The Dart typing system is also flexible, allowing the use of a dynamic type combined with runtime checks, which can be useful during experimentation or for code that needs to be especially dynamic.<strong><br>What is Google Flutter?</strong></p><p>Flutter is Google’s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter was originally launched with support for iOS and Android. Flutter 2 was launched as a stable release in March 2021, with support for Windows, macOS, Linux, and web. Flutter runs with Dart, a programming language developed by Google. Dart is a strongly-typed, object-oriented language with a familiar C-style syntax. Developers can compile Dart programs into fast native code that runs smoothly on all supported platforms. On the web, Dart is compiled to JavaScript code that can run on the browser. Flutter is composed of three architectural layers: the Flutter framework, which is written in Dart and provides all the widgets that developers use to build their apps; the Flutter Engine, written in C++, which provides low-level rendering support with Google’s Skia; and the platform-specific Embedder, which talks directly to the operating system.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why did Google create Flutter?</strong></p><p>Flutter, first known as “Sky”, was announced in 2015 with Android support only. It was created to provide a better mobile experience for users and developers, taking the best parts of the web development experience, and bringing them to mobile. Its main goals were high-performance and portability across multiple platforms. While other cross-platform solutions such as React Native and Xamarin were already popular, they could not deliver the same fidelity and performance as apps built with the native iOS and Android SDKs. Flutter changed that by making it possible to create beautiful, performant apps across multiple platforms with a single codebase.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Is Flutter in demand?</strong></p><p>Flutter has been a production-ready, stable product on iOS and Android since its official launch in December 2018. Big companies such as eBay, BMW, Alibaba, and Toyota are using Flutter as the core framework for their mobile app development strategy. Over a hundred thousand Flutter apps have already been published on the App Store and Play Store. After overtaking React Native in Google Search trends, Flutter is now the fastest growing software project on GitHub. By choosing Flutter, companies can deliver mobile apps in record-time as they no longer have to build separate apps to support iOS and Android. This makes Flutter an ideal choice for startups, agencies, and small businesses, and as a result, the job market for Flutter developers is also expanding rapidly.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Is Flutter a programming language?</strong></p><p><strong>Flutter is not a language</strong>, rather an SDK just like Android SDK. For android development Java/Kotlin are the programming languages, for cross-platform development using flutter, DART is the official programming language.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Is Flutter a frontend or backend?</strong></p><p><strong>Flutter</strong> is a popular <strong>frontend </strong>development framework from Google that enables developers to build beautiful frontends for any screen. Flutter is designed to streamline cross-platform app development while maintaining a consistent user experience.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Which language is used for Flutter?</strong></p><p>Flutter apps are written in the <strong>Dart language</strong> and make use of many of the language's more advanced features. While writing and debugging an application, Flutter runs in the Dart virtual machine, which features a just-in-time execution engine.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Is Flutter a framework?</strong></p><p><strong>Flutter is an open source framework by Google</strong> for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is Dart and why does Flutter use it?</strong></p><p>Flutter uses Dart as <strong>Dart allows Flutter to avoid the need for a separate declarative layout language like JSX and XML</strong>. The layout of Dart is declarative and programmatic and it makes it easy for developers to read and visualize it very easily and effortlessly.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Is Flutter written in Dart?</strong></p><p><strong>Flutter apps are written in the Dart language</strong> and make use of many of the language's more advanced features. While writing and debugging an application, Flutter runs in the Dart virtual machine, which features a just-in-time execution engine.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Who uses Dart programming language?</strong></p><p>Companies that use the Dart language include <strong>Google, Mews, Ag Flow, and Blossom</strong> to name a few. People generally find that Dart is one of the languages that are easier to grasp, as it is fairly similar to many other programming languages.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What applications use Flutter?</strong></p><p>There are social networking apps for creating and sharing content, dating, and connecting people through events and real-life activities that use Flutter. Alibaba made a shopping app called Xianyu, which has more than 50MM downloads and more than 10MM active users every day. Nubank is the largest independent digital bank outside Asia, and its mobile apps are built with Flutter. Another shopping app is HuYu, which rewards users with gift cards and vouchers for sharing shopping receipts. You can also find music apps for recording and learning to read music. The Hamilton Musical and the famous Abby Road Studios created apps with Flutter. There are apps for sports, finance, fitness, education, animal adoption, mapped gas stations to compare prices, and a travel app. A Google Ads app helps mobile app customers track their ads. Users can view statistics, update bids and budgets, and get real-time notifications.<strong><br><br><br>Google</strong> <strong>Flutter provides higher quality for multi-platform development.<br>Flutter apps use a single codebase, allowing faster time-to-market.<br>Flutter allows you to build beautiful apps easily.<br>Flutter widgets make it easy to build beautiful UIs.<br>The Dart programming language is very productive.<br>Flutter delivers an excellent developer experience with hot reload.<br>Flutter is open source.<br>Flutter comes with a mature ecosystem.<br>Flutter’s unique advantages make it a very strong UI framework on mobile, web, and desktop.<br><br></strong>This course will get you up and running quickly, and teach you the core knowledge you need to deeply understand and build dart flutter programming thus, <strong>we will have prepared a strong foundation for Flutter applications.</strong></p><p>This course is for beginners.

In this course, you will go on a journey to learn all the fundamental tools you need to become a confident and successful multithreaded application developer. Using <strong>multithreading</strong> and <strong>concurrency</strong> we will learn to get the most out of our computer to truly make it fly!</p><p><strong>Teaching Philosophy</strong></p><p>The course is designed to teach you \"how to fish\". Instead of memorizing classes, libraries, or Java APIs, we will learn the fundamentals of multithreaded programming, starting from the complete basics, all the way to the very advanced topics in multithreading.</p><p>All lectures include the right theory and are accompanied by practical examples from relevant fields such as:</p><ul><li><p>User Interface applications</p></li><li><p>Image Processing</p></li><li><p>Web Applications</p></li><li><p>Computational programs</p></li><li><p>And others</p></li></ul><p>It's a practical course that is meant to<strong> save you time. </strong>Instead of filling hours of material, I hand-picked the most important topics based on my practical experience.</p><p><strong>Target Student for this Course</strong></p><ul><li><p>Students who already have some experience and basic knowledge in programming in Java.</p></li><li><p>Students who want to acquire multithreaded, parallel programming and concurrency skills, in a short period of time.</p></li><li><p>Students who are interested in performance optimizations and getting a good foundation in the above-mentioned topics.</p></li><li><p>Students who want to take their careers to the next level. Whether you are a</p><ul><li><p>Newly graduate and you're looking to land a dream job.</p></li><li><p>A professional engineer who wants to become a better programmer and improve your skillset.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>A freelancer who wants to develop his/her own project and is looking to learn how to write efficient multithreaded code.</p><p><br></p><p>Then this course is for YOU!</p></li></ul><p><strong>Short Bio</strong></p><p>My passion for multithreading and concurrency started in college where I worked on a highly scalable, distributed, B+ Tree research project, sponsored by IBM.</p><p>Later I worked as a Computer Architecture Engineer at Intel Corporation and as a Software Engineer in other companies where I developed many applications and features involving efficient and optimized multithreaded code to deliver real-time video, audio, and data - in education, healthcare, augmented reality, and Ad Tech.</p><p>Today I am a Principal Software Engineer and Software Architect. Training and mentoring engineers on all levels is both my job and my passion.</p><p><strong>We will learn</strong></p><ul><li><p>Operating Systems fundamentals and motivation for multithreading and concurrency.</p></li><li><p>The basics of multithreading - how to create threads in Java as well as communicate between threads in Java.</p></li><li><p>Performance considerations and design patterns of multithreaded and parallel applications. Optimizing for latency or throughput.</p></li><li><p>Data sharing between threads in Java. All the pitfalls and challenges as well as the solutions and best practices.</p></li><li><p>Advanced lock-free algorithms and data structures for increased responsiveness and performance.</p></li></ul><p><strong>By the End of the Course</strong></p><p>You will be able to</p><ul><li><p>Write correct, responsive, and performant multithreaded applications in Java, for any purpose and scale.</p></li><li><p>Apply best practices to architect multithreaded applications, algorithms, and libraries.</p></li><li><p>Become knowledgeable in concurrency &amp; parallel programming, which will help you in job interviews, in your daily work as an engineer, as well as in your personal projects.</p></li></ul><p>Become an expert in Java Multithreading, Concurrency, and Performance Optimization today!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>FAQs</strong></p><p><em>- \"Will the course help me with interview questions?\"</em></p><p>Yes! The course is focused on helping you become proficient in multithreading and concurrency in general, and also master multithreading in Java in particular. You will learn all you need about threads in Java as well as common topics in interview questions involving locking, synchronization in Java, heap, and stack memory organization, and so on. Although the course is not focused on interview questions specifically, and there's no way to predict what you will be asked during an interview question, the knowledge you will get will definitely set you apart from other candidates.</p><p><br></p><p>- <em>\"Does the course cover all threading classes and APIs in Java?\"</em></p><p>\"No. There are many books and expensive academic courses which cover EVERY single class and API which would take months to finish. In addition, Oracle provides excellent Java Docs that cover and explain every single Java multithreading API and class.</p><p>This course is different!</p><p>Based on years of experience in the field, I have carefully designed a short curriculum that teaches you all the essentials in a short amount of time.</p><p>No fillers! No more wasting time learning things you could read yourself in 5 minutes or don't ever need!</p><p>This course will build the foundation for you to become an expert in multithreading and concurrency. And also be able to successfully and easily, extend your own knowledge in the future.</p><p><br></p><p>- <em>\"What if I don't understand something during the course and I have a question, what do I do?\"</em></p><p>Not a problem! I am here to help you succeed! Multithreading is not an easy topic and no one is expected to get it all right away. Each lecture has a Q&amp;A section where students can ask questions about the lecture or any follow-up questions about the topic in general. I (the instructor) will answer all the questions in a timely manner and make sure you have all the tools for success.</p><p><br></p><p>- <em>\"Does the course cover interprocess communication and distributed Systems?\"</em></p><p>No. Although those are really interesting and important topics that involve concurrency. They are not directly related to Java multithreading, which is the main topic of the course. We do mention those topics during the course but they are out of scope and deserve their own course. The concepts, use-cases, and challenges are very different than the ones we encounter while optimizing the performance of a single multithreaded Java application, algorithm, or library, so we will not cover them here.</p><p><br></p><p><em>- \"Why do I need a separate course for concurrent programming?\"</em></p><p>Concurrent programming is fundamentally different than transitional sequential programming. As in every engineering decision, there's always a tradeoff. Parallel and Concurrent programming can have a tremendous positive impact on the application's performance and responsiveness but is a lot harder to get it right. In this course, we will learn all the caveats, techniques, and best practices to get the most out of multithreaded applications in Java.</p>",

It has been consistently ranked as one of Udemy's <strong>top 3</strong> paid Java courses and has helped many students start their professional journey as \"confident\" Java programmers. Here is what some of the students had to say:</p><p><em>\"One of the best courses I have taken on coding in general! On par with courses you can take from </em><strong><em>Stanford</em></strong><em> </em><strong><em>Engineering</em></strong><em> </em><strong><em>Everywhere</em></strong><em>.\"&nbsp; ~ Kaloyan T.</em></p><p><em>\"I'm leaving this review a couple years after having completed this course. </em><strong><em>This is hands down the greatest online course I've ever taken</em></strong><em>. Extremely in-depth, extremely thorough, and Dheeru was always helpful when I asked questions. To really benefit from this course, you'll have to sit there and bang your head but if you take careful notes and make sure you can explain each step you're taking to solve a problem, you'll come out on top. I am now a </em><strong><em>data engineer</em></strong><em> and </em><strong><em>this course is one of the biggest catalysts for my transition into tech</em></strong><em>. Thank you Dheeru from a former student!\" ~ Carlvin Sanon</em></p><p><em>\"</em><strong><em>This is by far the best advanced as well as beginner course I have ever read/seen since Andre LaMothe quit writing.</em></strong><em>\" ~ Stephen Jonson</em></p><p>\"<em>Absolutely amazing, complete and in depth course. I would recommend this course to everyone interested in Java and programming in general. Dheeru Mundluru is an </em><strong><em>exemplary and responsive instructor</em></strong><em>. He explains the concepts with such clarity and with examples that every thing makes perfect sense. When I started this course, I only had vague idea of programming and now after completing this course I have a solid foundation to build upon. I would certainly say that due to this course I have </em><strong><em>fell in love with Java language and its ecosystem</em></strong><em>.</em>\" ~ <em>Muhammad Arsal Abdullah</em></p><p><em>\"This is a wonderful course. The Instructor is highly competent. </em><strong><em>He is a world-class instructor </em></strong><em>... Taking this course will definitely give you a </em><strong><em>tremendous appreciation</em></strong><em> for this great language.</em>\" ~ <em>Carrel d'Haiti</em></p><p><em>\"</em>... <strong><em>This one should be the best seller of all the other </em></strong>... <em>\"</em> ~ <em>Brady Adams</em></p><p>\"<em>I have bought so many courses but this course has been a </em><strong><em>game changer</em></strong><em> to me . It is in depth as the name says. </em><strong><em>It helped me pass a paid internship interview in a reputable company and now i am getting a job</em></strong><em>. Thank you so much Dheeru Mundluru for releasing such a great course. You deserve </em><strong><em>5+</em></strong>\" ~ <em>Stephen</em></p><p><em>\"... I have been a Java developer for </em><strong><em>8 </em></strong><em>years</em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>and hold a </em><strong><em>Masters degree in Computer Science</em></strong><em> ... </em><strong><em>This is honestly the very best online Java video course on the market</em></strong><em>...&nbsp;</em><strong><em>wish I had have had a course like this when I first started</em></strong><em>\" ~ Clive Stewart</em></p><p>\"<strong><em>This is THE best course on Java on Udemy - Period!</em></strong><em> Dheeru is not only passionate about what he is coaching but also OBSESSIVE and covers every minute detail of the subject ... Most lessons have demos which Dheeru makes sure that they do work without any glitches. </em><strong><em>He is a genius coder</em></strong><em> ... </em><strong><em>Lastly, he uses an accurate and powerful English vocabulary I'm yet to see from other instructors</em></strong><em>. </em><strong><em>If you want to learn Java right from installing, configuring and all the way to mastering its advanced topics - look no further - you are at the right place =&gt; THIS - IS - IT !!!</em></strong>\" ~ <em>Richard Reddy</em></p><p><em>\"The </em><strong><em>JVM internals section</em></strong><em> of this course itself is worth buying this course. Excellent teaching style.\" ~ Ryan Trang</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Course Overview:</strong></p><p>This course has been developed to just not teach core Java skills, but with a larger goal of helping you become a&nbsp;<strong><em>complete</em> &amp; <em>professional Java engineer</em></strong> right by the end of this course. To realize this, it takes a <em>holistic</em> approach in teaching Java programming. To ensure that you <strong><em>master Java language</em></strong>, the course has been developed to be highly comprehensive covering most of the Java language features and discussing them at a very in-depth level. To further ensure you are <strong><em>industry-ready</em></strong> and can write well-designed, professional code, tons of <em>best practices &amp; design principles</em> are explained and demonstrated in code. Towards this end, you'll also implement an <strong>instructor-led Java EE Web application</strong> using <em>professional coding conventions</em> with <strong>Eclipse</strong> as IDE. Finally, all your questions will receive <strong><em>in-depth personalized</em></strong> responses within around 24 hours. <em>Over </em><strong><em>10000</em></strong><em> questions have already been answered so far!</em><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Course Specifics</strong>:</p><p>This course begins by giving a birds-eye view of Java covering everything from origin of Java to installing Java and writing your first Java program. Even the most fundamental concepts like compilation &amp; interpretation are explained. All other topics are covered in-depth starting from <strong>language basics</strong>, <strong>object-oriented concepts &amp; design, JVM internals,&nbsp;exceptions, IO, collections framework, generics, multi-threading, databases, nested classes, enums, </strong>and <strong>functional-style programming</strong> via Java 8 constructs like <strong><em>lambdas &amp; streams</em></strong>. You'll also learn about <em>database designing</em>, implementation (<strong>SQL</strong>), and how to interact with them from Java programs (via <strong>JDBC</strong>). The course also gives a very good introduction to Java EE technologies like <strong>Servlets </strong>&amp; <strong>JSTL</strong>, which help in project implementation. Finally, an excellent <strong>Eclipse IDE tutorial</strong> is also included, which teaches you how to use Eclipse professionally for effectively <em>writing</em>, <em>debugging</em> and even <em>testing</em> Java programs using the <strong>JUnit</strong> framework.</p><p>Each lecture has been very carefully crafted explaining the <em>motivation </em>behind every concept. Each concept is clearly explained with well thought out examples &amp; illustrations and is demonstrated in code. Object-oriented concepts like inheritance &amp; polymorphism are explained through a <em>real-world case-study</em>, which is also implemented as part of the course project. Several challenging coding exercises &amp; quizzes are included to reinforce what you've learned. Your solutions for coding exercises are also auto-evaluated to help you instantly know whether or not the solution is correct.</p><p>The course project involves building a <strong>bookmarking Web application</strong> that helps users bookmark items like Books, Movies, and Web pages and is built progressively as new concepts are learned. The project is instructor-led and is implemented using professional <em>coding conventions &amp; best practices</em>. It follows good <em>object-oriented design</em>, incorporates <strong><em>MVC</em></strong> architectural pattern and also uses <em>Test-Driven Development</em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>(</em><strong><em>TDD</em></strong>) methodology. Java EE stack comprising technologies like Servlets, JSP, and JSTL are used for building the application with <strong>MySQL </strong>as the database and <strong>Apache Tomcat</strong> as the Web server. Parts of the project use <strong><em>advanced multi-threading</em></strong> capabilities. </p><p>Finally, course also teaches several <strong><em>best practices &amp; design principles</em></strong> that are essential for writing well-designed code. This is one of the highlights of the course and will make you truly complete!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Story behind Creating this Course</strong>:</p><p>The idea for building this Master Course has taken its roots during the instructor's (Dheeru Munduru) experience as a software engineer in Silicon Valley. After working for several years with many excellent engineers, Dheeru realized that sometimes the teams he worked with fell short of developing effective solutions. This led to several rounds of \"code refactoring\" resulting in loss of valuable time. This he realized was due to programming not being taught in the right way at most Universities &amp; Colleges across the world. Students are mostly taught core programming language features without any emphasis on best practices or design rules required for writing well-designed code. Due to this, developers are often ill-equipped when they have to come up with good solutions for complex problems. This leads to some quick ad-hoc &amp; incomplete learning, which often not only result in bad solutions, but also more importantly causes lot of stress on developer's part. This made Dheeru realize that a more holistic approach to teaching is needed where programming language features are taught along with best practices &amp; design principles needed for building well-designed robust software. This course is a result of this realization and it has taken him over <strong>5</strong> years of full-time effort (considered equivalent to over a <strong><em>decade</em></strong> if working part-time) in developing it. He will continue to devote himself in building this course towards making it one of the <strong><em>best Java courses</em></strong> out there.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Have you ever dreamed of creating your own mobile game? </p><p>Have you ever wanted to code your own mobile game? </p><p>If the answer is <strong>YES</strong>, then <strong>THIS course is for you</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>You can learn to code a 2D mobile game from the ground up.</p><p>Welcome to the Flame Engine 2D Game Crash Course where you will learn how to design and code a full mobile game in less than 6 hours.</p><p><br></p><p>There are so many <strong>game enthusiasts</strong> who would love to learn how to <strong>write mobile games</strong>, but do not necessarily have the time to dedicate to it.</p><p>Many Game Engines have a steep learning curve, so creating a full mobile game would take considerable time and effort.</p><p>We have created this course for all the coders who want to get into creating their own mobile game using a 2D Game Engine, and more importantly, we have created this course to take you from 0 to hero in less than 6 hours.</p><p>We have provided core<strong> 6 hours of lectures</strong> but, we also provided <em>more than </em><strong><em>5 extra hours </em>of Bonus Material including Coding Exercises</strong> and extra eplainers. </p><p><br><br><strong><em>Why Flame Engine</em></strong></p><p>The Flame Engine is a minimalist 2D game engine that runs on top of the Flutter framework. So it is light-weight with a small footprint.</p><p>This is perfect for mobile games.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Advantages of The Flutter Framework</em></strong></p><p>You work with <strong>one code base</strong> but get <strong>multiple platform deployment</strong>. Basically write once, and deploy to both <strong><em>iOS </em></strong>and <strong><em>Android</em></strong>. This is a huge advantage as it saves you time and effort.</p><p>And this is great for mobile games since we do not rely on the specific OS GUI as we basically take over the screen and create our own GUI from scratch.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Crash Course Format</em></strong></p><p>This is a crash course. So we remove all the fluff from the usual approach and we focus and zone in, with laser precision, on the fundamentals that apply to all 2D engines. We explain the necessary fundamentals such as:</p><p><br></p><ol><li><p><strong>Game Loop</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Component Rendering</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Spritesheet Animation</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Game Mechanics</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Inter-Component Communication and Messaging</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Component Interoperability and Composability</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Collision Detection</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Particle Physics</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Math for Game developers such as:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Vector Math</p></li><li><p>Velocity Control</p></li><li><p>Rotational Control</p></li><li><p>Collision Detection</p></li><li><p>Boundary Detection</p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>Game Parallax</strong> For Creating Complex Background Motion</p></li><li><p><strong>Sound Design</strong>&nbsp; - For Adding Sounds, Sound Effects, and Music to Your Game.</p></li><li><p>All The needed API will be explored as well.</p></li></ol><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Focus on Fundamentals</em></strong></p><p>We will spend the first 3 hours focusing on fundamentals with sample code and architectural examples.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Architectural Approach</em></strong></p><p>Our approach to teaching the material is a bit different from most courses. We take the <strong>architectural approach</strong>. This means that we will also teach you some <strong>Software Engineering</strong> while we are teaching you about the Flame Engine.</p><p>We will use <strong>UML diagrams</strong> to show you the context of what we are doing. All of this is to give you a better perspective of how everything fits together.</p><p>In other words we will not only work with code. The main objective here is to teach you to think <strong>like a Software Architect</strong>. We do not want you to just code this game. We want you to go through the process of designing and architecting it in a professional manner.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Using Case Studies</em></strong></p><p>Part of how we teach you in this course revolves around practical case studies. Each case study shows you a full solution to a given element of 2D game coding such as for example Joystick control or collision detection.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>The Game we will develop</em></strong></p><p>We will develop, from scratch, using our architectural approach, a game<strong><em> based on</em></strong> the famous retro-game from ATARI: Asteroids.</p><p>This is a perfect game for learning all the fundamentals.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Why this particular game</em></strong></p><p>This is a perfect game to learn a 2D game engine for the following reasons:</p><p><br></p><ol><li><p>It has great Game Mechanics such as:</p><ol><li><p>Spaceship Control</p></li><li><p>Spaceship Explosion</p></li><li><p>Tracking of Score and Player's Lives</p></li><li><p>Firing of Bullets</p></li><li><p>Asteroid Motion/Rotation and Splitting up</p></li><li><p>Occasional UFO&nbsp;Bonus Showing up</p></li><li><p>Deterministic Game Level Generation from a JSON&nbsp;File</p></li></ol></li><li><p>This will lead us to fully explore and understand:</p><ol><li><p>Joystick Control</p></li><li><p>Game Loop Update And Render</p></li><li><p>Timer Component Callbacks</p></li><li><p>Vector Math</p></li><li><p>Collision Detection</p></li><li><p>Particle Physics</p></li><li><p>Refresh-Rate Independent Rendering</p></li><li><p>Sounds Design and Game Music</p></li><li><p>Parallax Effects for Background</p></li></ol></li></ol><p>This game is also great to be played on both a phone as well as a tablet device.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Assumptions</em></strong></p><p>We assume that you have some coding experience and we also assume that you know Flutter/Dart and have worked with it.</p><p><br></p><p>But in case you have not worked with Flutter do not fret!</p><p><br></p><p>The course is designed to help you with the setup and a solid understanding of the language elements because of the architectural approach.</p><p><br></p><p>So in reality all you need is experience with any Object Oriented language such as <strong>Java, Swift, C#, C++</strong>, or <strong>TypeScript </strong>and you will be fine!<br><br><br><strong><em>Practice Makes Perfect</em></strong></p><p>For each Case Study we have provided you with a number of Coding Exercises. </p><p>We also provide Solution Videos to explain the solution itself, along with code and some PDF&nbsp;materials as well.</p>",

    "description": "<p>We all want to become better software developers and be able to call ourselves \"Software Engineers\" or \"Software Architects\", but to do that you first have to master a number of design patterns.</p><p>This course will put you on a track to that destination. </p><p>We will teach you how to recognize when to use specific design patterns to build complex systems in a divide-and-conquer manner so that complexity is reduced and abstracted.</p><p>But rather than learning all the design patterns out there, we have curated the <strong>most important, the top fundamental GoF Design Patterns for you. </strong></p><p><br></p><p>All of that in the context of the <strong>Flutter </strong>Framework using <strong>Dart</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>We start with full understanding of the <strong>S.O.L.I.D Design Principles </strong>and how they in turn relate to those design patterns. We eplain everything in the context of real-wprld problems as well as specific code examples.</p><p>At the end of the course you will get to Architect a solution by coding John Conway's <strong><em>Game of Life</em></strong> simulation which will run on your mobile device.</p><p><br></p><p>Complex software systems are plagued with three major issues:</p><ol><li><p>Timelines are stretched as requirements change.</p></li><li><p>Multiple developers have a hard time coordinating their efforts.</p></li><li><p>Code redundancy.<br></p></li></ol><p>This in turn creates issues with maintenance and overall flexibility for adding new features. In general this means poorly designed systems that are hard to maintain and are not adaptable.</p><p>One answer to all the above problems is having a <strong>proper design and architecture</strong>. Think of a skyscraper being built. <strong>There is always a high-level blueprint.</strong> This blueprint is used to show everybody involved (from architects to supply chain to construction workers to machinery scheduling etc…) what is being worked on.</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody understands and follows the same vision.</p><p><br></p><p>A blueprint has a number of commonly understood elements which repeat themselves across many projects. For example all buildings need electrical wiring and plumbing, they might need elevators, and cooling systems, and underground parking lots, and of course stairs. They also usually are connected to the electrical grid and water supply as well as… roads.</p><p>All these common elements follow certain standards that have been improved over many many years and across many many projects. They are well understood and can be used almost like recipes.</p><p>In Software Engineering we also have a set of elements that repeat themselves across many projects. For example all software applications need to create objects, they need to communicate state change across those objects, they need to be able traverse over collections of those objects. In other words, if you want to be a better developer then you need to become proficient in those elements that have been time-tested. <strong>In the Software Engineering world these elements are known as <em>“Design Patterns”</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>This course will teach students how to recognize when to use specific design patterns to build complex systems in a divide-and-conquer manner so that complexity is reduced and abstracted.</p><p>This will help you to design projects in an Architectural manner before any major development happens and can be used to shorten development time and reduce maintenance costs.</p><p><br></p><p>Design patterns are important because they are time-tested recipes or solutions to well-known software engineering problems. When creating software applications certain problems recur in a pretty predictable fashion so rather than ‘reinvent’ the wheel we will have an assortment of, if you will, wheels to choose from.</p><p>We will teach you this in a slightly different manner than you probably have been taught before. We will take a practical approach (i.e. specific examples) but the power of Design Patterns comes from their ‘concept’ and we will teach you the concept of those design patterns so that you are fully able to change them and modify them to your needs. In addition we will look at how to combine all those patterns into something greater: an architecture.</p><p><br></p><p>A well designed Architecture is this magical thing where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.<br></p><p>This is what we will strive to teach you.</p><p><br></p>",

Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient: with no runtime or garbage collector, it can power performance-critical services, run on embedded devices, and easily integrate with other languages.</p><p><strong>What is WebAssembly?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>WebAssembly is a new type of code that can be run in modern web browsers — it is a low-level assembly-like language with a compact binary format that runs with near-native performance and provides languages such as C/C++, C#, and Rust with a compilation target so that they can run on the web. It is also designed to run alongside JavaScript, allowing both to work together.</p><p><strong>Is this course right for you?</strong></p><p>If you plan to start your career as a developer or improve your programming skills, this course is right for you. Learn how to build a browser game with minimal JS and Rust code compiled into WebAssembly instructions.</p><p>You will get the confidence and skills required to start your projects during this course. In addition, you will get the right mindset to apply for a developer career.</p><p><strong>What are you going to work on?</strong></p><p>You will build the Snake game from scratch. You will learn to write code in Rust language, static type, compiled language.</p><p>The course starts with an explanation and practical examples of the Rust language. You will learn Rust-specific features such as \"moving\" and \"copying\"</p><p>Rust doesn't have a garbage collector. Memory is cleared when the values are getting out of the scope. You will learn how to manage this concept with ease.</p><p>The next feature you will learn of is borrowing and references. Through references, you will be able to access values without owning them.</p><p>In the beginning lectures, we will also talk about memory management in Stack and the Heap structures, modularity, strings, and other essential topics.</p><p>After Rust's introduction lectures, you will start building your Snake game. You will learn how to structure the application modular and cleanly.&nbsp;</p><p>You will build your own JS frontend, exposed through a simple Webpack development server. Later, you will transform JS implementation into TS (Typescript). This will specify types and be on the same page as Rust code.</p><p>You will build your rust backend code, the backbone of our game. You will learn how to compile Rust code into WebAssembly code. WebAssembly is code that can run in the browser. It's faster (almost Native speed) and more efficient than JS.</p><p>At the end of the course, we will create a production server and deploy our game to Heroku, so anybody on the internet can play our game.</p>",

Here you will learn the things that will accompany you throughout your career and really help you as a clear concept for the architecture of your software, the testing and how we deal with dependencies.</p><p><strong>Don't worry - there's something for everyone here. <br></strong>Whether you're an experienced developer or a complete beginner - We'll meet you at your level of experience and abstraction and guide you by the hand from the first small Flutter App to professional software architecture, functional programming, testing and much more.</p><p><strong>In this still young framework, there are few people who are really good</strong>. <br>This means there are many possibilities here. With the ever-increasing number of apps implemented with the Flutter Framework, so does the demand for capable developers. And you can become one of them!</p><p>Also: Flutter and the Dart language are great, really fun to develop and play around with!</p><p><strong>Flutter Community</strong> <br>We already have the largest active German Flutter Community on our own Discord server.

We will also dive into the essential parts of programming using Dart language and we will learn how to set up our development environment and deal with the Code Editor VS Code. We'll start with the basic knowledge of what a variable actually is and then work our way up to object orientation and asynchronous programming.<br><br><strong>⭐️ Flutter Basics</strong></p><p>Here we'll give you an introduction to the most important elements of UI creation with the Flutter Framework and teach you all&nbsp; you need to write your own user interfaces for your apps. From the explanation of how the framework works, to the use of individual UI components, themes, animations, navigation and much more, everything is included!<br><br><strong>⭐️ Clean Architecture</strong></p><p>Based on a simple app that we will develop, we will learn how proper app development with <strong>clean software architecture</strong> works. </p><p>We will implement this small and simple app with a bulletproof clean code software architecture (<strong>clean layer separation</strong>), which<strong> you can use for any customer app</strong>. Once you have internalized this architecture and type of work, your software will achieve extremely high quality standards. We integrate the BLoC pattern into our project and thus cleanly separate business logic from UI, so we have a very clean and testable project.<strong> Dependency injection</strong> and <strong>functional programming </strong>are just a few tools that will support us on our way. Of course, we will also cover <strong>unit testing, widget testing and integration testing</strong> to check our app for everything.<br><br></p><p><strong><em>❗️ </em>Important: </strong>In this course, we aim to give you all the knowledge you need to start app development with Flutter quickly and effectively. We are not too \"obsessed with details\" and will not go into all the complex background processes that you are taught in an university course, for example. Rather we will dive into praxis as soon as possible.</p><p><strong>Our focus is on practicality, quality and - last but not least- fun.</strong></p><p><br></p>",

    "description": "<p>Rust is a modern systems programming language designed with safety to simplify the development of large, complex software projects. Data structure and Algorithms are key to help in the collection and organization of the data for performing operations on the data and set instructions/logic to accomplish tasks in these projects. This course will be your guide for implementing classic data structures and algorithms in Rust, helping you to get up and running as a confident Rust programmer.</p><p>You will begin with a primer to Rust and its syntax. You will then explore the language of Time and Memory complexity by comparing different sorting methods. You’ll then learn about Lists and Binary Trees, implement them, and compare them, to show the advantages and use cases of each.

    "description": "<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>C programming language still remains one of the most popular and used languages in 2022.</p><p>There is a high demand for C developers in the market - at both large companies as well as startups. Thus, having good C programming skills can give you great career options in different industries, such as:</p><p>- Cyber Security.</p><p>- Smart Homes &amp;&nbsp;Smart Cities.</p><p>- Drones.</p><p>- And especially in Embedded Systems where you have Sensors and Micro-Controllers.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What you will learn in this course?</strong></p><p>There is an 'ancient' phrase saying \"to become an expert in C - you need to master pointers\".</p><p>One of the main objectives of this course is designed to take your basic knowledge of pointers (one of the most significant topics) to the next level. The goal is to take the basic skills you've gained so far in C&nbsp;programming and take this knowledge to a whole new level. </p><p>We will cover pointers, memory addressing, pointers to functions, advanced concepts of structs and dynamic memory allocation, and so much more.</p><p>The beauty of this course is that it regularly gets updated with new material. And the material being added to the course these days includes lots of information in the low-level programming (the bits and bytes), preparation for usage of Embedded C in Embedded Systems, and other very important topics for the next generation of engineers.</p><p>This course covers the topics in-depth, from different angles, and with various visualizations and illustrations - that should make the learning process of pointers and low-level programming much easier and fun for you.</p><p>Also, you will get a whole dedicated section on how to use a debugger and what is the debugging process that may help you so much in developing your future applications.</p><p>After completing this course you will gain plenty of new skills and knowledge that may improve your chances of getting a job position as a C&nbsp;Developer as well as increasing your chances to pass the exam (if you're still a student).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What's different about this course?</strong></p><p>Vlad Budnitski will be your instructor for this course.</p><p>He has years of experience working as a Software Developer (also working with complex systems developed in C language). As well as 4 years of experience teaching C&nbsp;Programming for Beginners and Advanced C&nbsp;Programming in College.</p><p>So you got lucky on this one because you will get knowledge from a practical software developer and experienced instructor.</p><p>You will get a handpicked, concise, and straight to the point material that you will be amazed by the way these complicated pointers can be taught.</p><p>This course is also guided with concrete exercises, challenges, and full solution videos - that will help you to practice the materials.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Who's this course for?</strong></p><p>First of all, this course is not for \"absolute beginners\" and it requires you to have at least the basic knowledge of programming. It's assumed you have some knowledge of the basics in C&nbsp;- preferably having completed our \"C&nbsp;Programming for Beginners\" course (here on Udemy).</p><p>This course is great both for students in college as well as graduates who need to learn and understand pointers in depth.</p><p>In addition, if you're planning to explore and master the Embedded Systems domain using Embedded C - then this course is a great preparation of various topics for the Embedded Domain. Once you master all the concepts of this course you'll be a few steps closer to proceeding and mastering Embedded Systems, programming Micro Controllers, etc.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Do you still have got doubts?</strong></p><p>That's OK. Pointers can get us all confused to some extent... If you're still unsure if this course is exactly what you're looking for, feel free to go over the full detailed curriculum. Then, enroll in the course and be sure that you've done a great decision to improve your knowledge in pointers and to become a better C&nbsp;developer.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Note: This course is intended for absolute beginners to programming OR those who don't mind a slower pace to learning Java. If you're looking for a faster-paced course, this may not be for you (though you can play back at 2x speed &amp; may still find great things to learn). Also, even for those who already know some basic Java, you could skip over the parts you already know and focus on those you may not, like Regex, Streams/Lambdas API, Optionals, Date/Time, SQL/Database/JDBC sections that even seasoned Java developers may not know as well as they should. Many of my sections on these APIs are as long or longer than MANY stand-alone courses dedicated to just one of these topics - for similar prices. Check out my preview videos from each of those sections to gauge how deep I go into each topic.</p><p>If you're interested in starting a new career as a professional software developer, learn the fundamentals from an instructor who has interviewed, hired, managed &amp; mentored numerous developers over the years. This course will teach you all the REAL Java skills you need to land your first job and excel. It focuses on skills you're actually likely to use most often and tries to de-emphasize more \"academic\" knowledge.&nbsp; &nbsp;The instructor has taken his experiences and observations of both successful and unsuccessful developer candidates to create a course that tries to ensure success in landing highly-coveted developer jobs.</p><p>In this course, you'll learn such topics as:<br></p><ul><li><p>Object Oriented Programming (OOP) </p><ul><li><p>Too many so-called \"Java\" developers have learned the syntax of the language but have no idea how to harness its actual power to write sophisticated software that's easier to maintain and collaborate on.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Regular Expressions</p><ul><li><p>Another unfortunate observation is that a majority of Java developers are very weak with Regular Expressions. This is unfortunate because so much of what Java tends to be used for, involves processing text and checking that it is valid or parsing key information out of it. Without the use of Regular Expressions, these tasks require considerable amounts of error-prone code that is inflexible and difficult to maintain.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Functional Programming with Lambdas &amp; Streams API</p><ul><li><p>Another sore-spot among a large number of Java developers. As of 2021, Java 17 is out, but the Functional programming APIs of Lambdas &amp; Streams were introduced into Java with version 8. We've observed that developers simply aren't keeping up with these powerful (not-so-new anymore) techniques that help keep Java competitive and efficient in an increasingly functional programming world. You can sift through large datasets with ease and significantly less code with these APIs.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Optionals</p><ul><li><p>Tony Hoare, the inventor of the programming concept of \"null\", called its invention his \"billion-dollar mistake\" dating back to 1965. That mistake has gone on to wreak havoc across numerous programming language ever since. Optionals seek to remedy that mistake. Unfortunately, not enough Java developers have learned and embraced the power of using Optionals. This topic seeks to remedy that shortcoming.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Java 8 Date/Time API</p><ul><li><p>Java was introduced in 1995 and heralded as the great, shiny new programming language of our time. To a large degree, one could argue that it is indeed, that. However, mistakes were made along the way. One of those mistakes was the way dates &amp; times were handled. Java 8 made major strides in fixing those mistakes, but as with Optionals, Lambdas and many other topics mentioned, not enough developers have taken the time to learn the new and greatly improved Java 8 Date/Time API. We'll show you how to keep time the right way.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Working with Databases &amp; SQL</p><ul><li><p>One of the topics where it seems Java developers actually have kept up (mostly) is in learning modern ways to work with databases in Java - primarily through the use of frameworks like Spring Boot. However, one unfortunate side-effect of the massive levels of abstraction these frameworks afford us, is that many developers have little-to-no idea of what these frameworks are doing or how to use them to maximum effect. We'll peel back the covers and give a solid foundation of the basics to better empower developers as they inevitably continue to use frameworks to make this work easier. </p></li></ul></li><li><p>An Introduction to The Spring Framework &amp; Spring Boot</p><ul><li><p>The Spring Framework &amp; its sibling, Spring Boot, have absolutely revolutionized modern Java software development - particularly for business. Dare I say virtually no company doing Java these days, even considers doing it without Spring or at least one of its few and much less popular competitors. You WILL&nbsp;have to learn Spring to be a true and well-rounded Java developer competitive in the job market. Though this course if focused on the fundamentals of Java, we knew we had to whet your appetite for the full(er) stack of Java development. Spring is what most companies use to enable their Java applications to become web applications and web services and talk to databases. This module will set you up for Neutrino's upcoming course dedicated to the topic in full (because it deserves its own course).</p></li></ul></li></ul><p><br></p><p>So, if you're willing to put in the work, come join us and begin the next phase of your career.</p>",

Includes basic to advanced topics and projects. Prepared <strong>Dart Flutter</strong> App.<br><br><strong>Flutter</strong> is a Google SDK for building native interfaces for iOS and Android using the <strong>Dart programming language.</strong><em> Flutter</em> can integrate with existing iOS and <strong>Android </strong>code bases. It's free and open-source.<br><br><strong>Flutter</strong> is Google’s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. <strong>Flutter dart </strong>was originally launched with support for iOS and Android. Flutter 2 was launched as a stable release in March 2021, with support for Windows, macOS, Linux, and web. Flutter runs with <strong>dart</strong>, a programming language developed by Google. <strong>Dart</strong> is a strongly-typed, object-oriented language with a familiar C-style syntax. Developers can compile Dart programs into fast native code that runs smoothly on all supported platforms. On the web, <strong>dart flutter</strong> is compiled to JavaScript code that can run on the browser. <strong>Flutter web</strong> is composed of three architectural layers: <strong>the Flutter framework</strong>, which is written in Dart and provides all the widgets that developers use to build their apps; the <strong>flutter firebase</strong> Engine, written in C++, which provides low-level rendering support.<br><strong><br>Learn more about Google Flutter</strong></p><p>Flutter is a Google SDK for building native interfaces for iOS and Android using the Dart programming language. Flutter can integrate with existing iOS and Android code bases. It's free and open-source.</p><p><strong>Frequently asked questions about Flutter on Udemy<br><br>Why did Google create Flutter?<br><br></strong>Flutter, first known as “Sky”, was announced in 2015 with Android support only. It was created to provide a better mobile experience for users and developers, taking the best parts of the web development experience, and bringing them to mobile. Its main goals were high-performance and portability across multiple platforms. While other cross-platform solutions such as React Native and Xamarin were already popular, they could not deliver the same fidelity and performance as apps built with the native iOS and Android SDKs. Flutter changed that by making it possible to create beautiful, performant apps across multiple platforms with a single codebase.<br><br><strong>Is Flutter in demand?</strong><br>Flutter has been a production-ready, stable product on iOS and Android since its official launch in December 2018. Big companies such as eBay, BMW, Alibaba, and Toyota are using Flutter as the core framework for their mobile app development strategy. Over a hundred thousand Flutter apps have already been published on the App Store and Play Store. After overtaking React Native in Google Search trends, Flutter is now the fastest growing software project on GitHub. By choosing Flutter, companies can deliver mobile apps in record time as they no longer have to build separate apps to support iOS and Android. This makes Flutter an ideal choice for startups, agencies, and small businesses, and as a result, the job market for Flutter developers is also expanding rapidly.</p><p><strong><br>What applications use Flutter?<br></strong>There are social networking apps for creating and sharing content, dating, and connecting people through events and real-life activities that use Flutter. Alibaba made a shopping app called Xianyu, which has more than 50MM downloads and more than 10MM active users every day. Nubank is the largest independent digital bank outside Asia, and its mobile apps are built with Flutter. Another shopping app is HuYu, which rewards users with gift cards and vouchers for sharing shopping receipts. You can also find music apps for recording and learning to read music. The Hamilton Musical and the famous Abby Road Studios created apps with Flutter. There are apps for sports, finance, fitness, education, animal adoption, mapped gas stations to compare prices, and a travel app. A Google Ads app helps mobile app customers track their ads.<strong><br><br><br>Google</strong> <strong>Flutter provides higher quality for multi-platform development.<br>Flutter apps use a single codebase, allowing faster time-to-market.<br>Flutter allows you to build beautiful apps easily.<br>Flutter widgets make it easy to build beautiful UIs.<br>The Dart programming language is very productive.<br>Flutter delivers an excellent developer experience with hot reload.<br>Flutter is open source.<br>Flutter comes with a mature ecosystem.<br>Flutter’s unique advantages make it a very strong UI framework on mobile, web, and desktop.<br><br></strong>This course will get you up and running quickly, and teach you the core knowledge you need to deeply understand and build dart flutter programming thus, <strong>we will have prepared a strong foundation for Flutter applications.</strong></p><p>This course is for beginners.

    "description": "<p><strong>This Course in a Nutshell</strong></p><p>Aimed at beginner Python developers, this course will provide you a fundamental <strong>understanding</strong> of how to program in Python. Your journey will take you from a total Python beginner to an intermediate level Python developer more than ready to tackle your own professional projects.</p><p><br></p><p>This course will provide you the solid foundation you will need to continue moving forward in your Python development endeavors. This course is not a \"here's how I do it, just type along please\" type of course - its goal is to make you understand each and every line of code we are going to write together, why we write it and why it works, giving you the knowledge to apply the same coding techniques to your own situation and problems.</p><p><br>Like any good college level course, this course is fairly lengthy and will require time, not only for watching the videos, but also working on your own to explore the various topics, trying things out, and at the end of each section working on increasingly complex problems. It takes a certain amount of time to master a programming language, and this course is no exception. If you are looking for a quick and superficial intro to Python, then this course is probably not for you.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Course Overview</strong></p><p>This course balances theory and coding practice. Most subjects are two-part: a theory (or <strong>lecture</strong>) video where we cover a specific topic, explain how things work, followed by a practice (or <strong>coding</strong>) video which takes the lecture material and applies it using real code. I highly encourage you to <strong>take notes</strong> during the lectures, and <strong>code along</strong> with me during the coding videos - that's the beauty of online videos - you can pause, rewind, speed up, slow down as you need! </p><p><br></p><p>All the course slides (over 900 of them!) are available for download if you prefer that approach over taking your own notes.</p><p><br></p><p>We use Jupyter notebooks as the perfect tool for teaching and learning Python.</p><p>Jupyter notebooks support both Python code as well as interspersed markdown documentation. You will find that every code video in this course has a <strong>corresponding Jupyter notebook</strong> available in the course downloads, that not only reproduces all the code we do in the coding videos, but is <strong>fully annotated</strong> with explanations of the code, basically what I cover in the coding videos, and sometimes more!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>All the notebooks and the data files we will work with, are available in the course downloads in the first section of this course as well as in GitHub.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>At the <strong>end of each section</strong>, you will find a <strong>set of exercises with solutions</strong>. It is imperative that you work through these exercises, and only move on to the next section once you are able to do these exercises on your own. Each section of this course builds on top of the previous one!</p><p><br></p><p>The course is broadly broken down into three main parts:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Python Basics</strong></p><ul><li><p>What is Python</p></li><li><p>How to install Python</p></li><li><p>How to create and use virtual environments</p></li><li><p>How to run Python and Jupyter notebooks</p></li><li><p>Basic data types including integers, floats, booleans</p></li><li><p>Boolean operators</p></li><li><p>Arithmetic and comparison operators, as well as operator precedence</p></li><li><p>Conditional execution</p></li><li><p>Looping (for and while)</p></li><li><p>Sequence types such as lists, tuples and strings</p></li><li><p>Working with sequence types (iterating, slicing, manipulating, copying, unpacking)</p></li><li><p>More on strings and Unicode</p></li><li><p>Dictionaries and sets</p></li><li><p>Python's list, dictionary and set comprehensions</p></li><li><p>Exceptions and exception handling</p></li><li><p>Iterables and iterators, including generators</p></li><li><p>Writing user defined functions and different ways of defining and passing arguments</p></li><li><p>Lambda functions</p></li><li><p>Some of Python's built-in functions (such as zip, sorted, min, max, and round)</p></li></ul><p><strong>Intermediate Python</strong></p><ul><li><p>Higher order functions (passing and returning functions from functions)</p></li><li><p>Maps (dictionaries)</p></li><li><p>Closures</p></li><li><p>Advanced sorting and filtering</p></li><li><p>Decorators - what they are, and how to write your own</p></li><li><p>Reading and writing text files</p></li><li><p>Python's module and import system</p></li><li><p>How to work with dates and times</p></li><li><p>How to read and write CSV files</p></li><li><p>Random numbers and sampling</p></li><li><p>A look at Python Math and Stats modules</p></li><li><p>Decimal data type - for when floats aren't precise enough</p></li><li><p>How to write your own custom Classes (OOP)</p></li></ul><p><strong>3rd Party Libraries</strong></p><ul><li><p>the <em>pytz</em> library for dealing with timezones and daylight savings</p></li><li><p>the <em>dateutil</em> library for parsing date/time strings</p></li><li><p>What is JSON data, and how to read and write JSON</p></li><li><p>What are REST APIs</p></li><li><p>How to use the <em>requests</em> library for HTTP/s requests (and how to interact with a REST API)</p></li><li><p>Fundamentals of the <em>NumPy</em> library for fast numerical computations</p></li><li><p>Fundamentals of the <em>Pandas</em> library for working with data sets (including indexing)</p></li><li><p>Fundamentals of the <em>matplotlib</em> library for charting data</p></li></ul>",

Therefore, there is no deed to any property. You own nothing, and therefore are not obligated to any long term contract or maintenance fees for what is merely a club membership.&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Mexico does not have a credit reporting system and cannot \"legally\" report to American credit reporting agencies.</p></li><li><p>The jurisdiction for any legal issues with Mexico vacation clubs remain in Mexico. Even if the Mexico vacation club has offices or affiliates (i.e. Universal vacation club, resorts international , GBS&nbsp;International) within the U.S., because the contract was signed in Mexico, there is nothing that they can do to those who cancel. </p></li></ol><p><br></p><p><strong>FEBRUARY 2023 BONUS:</strong></p><p><em>Contracts Review Service</em></p><p>If you sign up to this course during the Month of February,&nbsp; I will give you the <strong>Contracts Review Service</strong> ($140.00 Value) for FREE. </p><p><strong>The Contracts Review Service includes the following features: </strong></p><ol><li><p>Review your Mexico vacation club membership documents</p></li><li><p>Provide feedback in a personalized report on your options to cancel your membership</p></li><li><p>Develop a personal one on one strategy and guide you through the cancellation process</p></li></ol><p><strong>Why I Created This Contracts Review Service (February 2023 BONUS)</strong></p><p>The reason that I decided to design this service is because of the additional work that I have been doing with students who have completed <em>The Mexico Timeshare Cancellation Course</em>.</p><p>Even though the course is sufficient to cancel, many students had additional questions and challenges that were not included in the course as some vacation club memberships has its own set of peculiarities.

Completed the course for almost a week ago. Could I give you TEN STARS I would!! The course was presented both to you in a pleasant and straight forward way to give you the knowledge how the scam industry regarding timeshare/vacantionclub membership (the lather in my/our case) works. The course gives you strength and courage the want to try to redeem some of the money the gone lost in the in the process \"wanting to believe that I've made made a good investment\". Now after taking the course, the hard truth about vacation club membership is that ....you don't own ANYTHING, JUST AIR ( as Wayne describes it) and that equals the right to call to make a booking, but the outcome of the booking is still on their terms and within their control. You are lucky if you even get the type of room that you are supposed to within your contact. Money lost....you own air....you have no right to demand anything. Everything sign of being scammed from the beginning is there right in front of you but THE SALES PEOPLE are so skilled that they make you not seeing it until it is too late. It is all planned by them from the beginning as soon as you arrive in paradise(their paradise)...don't think otherwise. THE COURSE has giving us the knowledge and courage to walk away by stop paying them anymore money(in our case auto monthly withdrawals) by blocking them. They can't legally touch you if you come from outside the country. THE COURSE GIVES YOU GOOD INSIGHT IN THAT AND AMONG OTHER THINGS AND TOOLS REGARDING IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS We are going to try to get some refund regarding our recent upgrade....with help from the tools giving to use by taking this COURSE. The heaven has to probably fall down first before an eventual success.....but we will give it a try. THE FINAL......TAKE THE COURSE !!!!!! IT IS ALL SO WORTH IT!!!!!!! THANK YOU AGAIN WAYNE.

However, everything in this course was 100% correct. He was right in how they deceive the consumer, use tactics and tricks to get the sale, and I was surprised to learn that legally they cannot take action against us because they aren't financial institutions and the vacation clubs don't even have licenses. This was super informative and I feel less stressed and more empowered. More importantly, I will never do this again. I am appreciative of Wayne sharing his knowledge to help the consumer win against these fraudulent Mexican vacation clubs.</em>\" -<strong>Wendy Boyd, Udemy student</strong></p><p><br></p><p>\"<em>I am so, so thankful for this course and Wayne's guidance.

    "description": "<p>This is the newest complete IELTS preparation course for anyone taking the Academic or General IELTS test. You will learn the most up to date tips / techniques and learn from real IELTS materials. My video course is the most recent to be added to UDEMY so please learn form the newest material and the latest tips. The old videos on UDEMY are most likely outdated and have old information.</p><p>In this IELTS full preparation course you will learn everything about each part of the IELTS test along with impressive vocabulary, linking words and must know tips. Together we will begin with Speaking part 1, 2 and then 3. You will learn many things including how you can continue speaking even if you have nothing left to talk about. I promise you are learning from the best. I have been teaching IELTS &amp; English since 2008, which means I have a lot of experience. In addition, (which means AND) I have a large Instagram following where I not only do Zoom lessons but also post some useful English phrases and expressions. Once you join my video course you can contact me anytime for help and also a practice speaking test, if you like. My ID: English_Grammar_vocab_ielts </p><p>After the Speaking video lesson we will move on to Writing where you will learn part 1 &amp; 2. I have made this section much easier for you, so you can use my one structure for almost all of the different types of writing. By following my structure, your writing will sound more formal and help you to achieve your IELTS band score.</p><p>Following the writing we will go through listening where you will learn how they try to trick you, in this section of the test. Did you know that sometimes the answer is not what they say in the recording but what they DO NOT say. (I will talk about this in much more detail in the course) After you learn how to approach the listening section you will get the chance to try a full IELTS listening test, which is a real test that has been used in the past.</p><p>Finally we will finish with the Reading section, where you will learn about the 15 different question types. I have made it easier for you and combined the 15 questions into only 6 main question types. You will also learn tips for the reading such as, which questions ALWAYS go in order to the reading and which NEVER go in order. This can be very helpful to know, so that it saves you time in the reading test.</p><p>I will also provide some advice for you on what you should do on the day of your test as well as things you should not be doing. I have worked extremely hard creating this IELTS FULL PREPARATION video course so that you don't have to. In my video course it has only what you must know and no extra information that is not needed. Too many teacher give students too many paper handouts and too much unhelpful information. </p><p> Enroll in my video course and lets do this together step by step. I will be with you all of the way and when you finish your test, I want you to message me on Instagram to let me know the good news.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>",

    "description": "<p>There are way too many programming languages and infinite use-cases for each one of them, every day developers are coming up with something new and we need to keep up with the flow.</p><p>Both of these technologies are relatively new when you compare them to the most popular languages and frameworks, they have been looking over for some years now but I would consider this combo to be ahead of its time like if you sold an electric car in 1995.</p><p>Let me tell you why:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is Dart?<br></strong>Let’s kick this off by explaining some qualities of Dart.</p><p>First, it is developed by Google and it launched in 2011. Google uses Dart to develop many of its main applications including Ads which as you can imagine must require quite a solid build.</p><p>Dart is very flexible in the way it is compiled and executed, it is in fact the only programming language capable of compiling JIT (Just In Time — used during development) and AOT (Ahead Of Time — used when the app is released), it can also be compiled to Javascript in order to be run by browsers or straight to native code. This means its execution is <em>fast.</em></p><p>Thanks to its versatility Dart can be used for client or server-side development. The syntax looks like ‘C’ meaning it is statically typed so this provides more certainty on the types of values you are passing on, but it is also meant to be used in OOP, if you have a background in C you’ll pick it up quick. Dart also shares some similarities with Javascript like the use of arrows and asynchronous functions.</p><p>Let’s not forget about ‘hot reload’.</p><p>You can test your code like if it was HTML and you were refreshing the page to see the changes. Yes, it is that easy.</p><p>Dart has been slept on by the dev community for too long but I think its time is coming with the mobile-first principle that is gaining such massive momentum. It runs fast on all platforms and is easy to pick up and learn by programmers.</p>",

This course can also be utilized in your <strong>Yoga Teacher Training program </strong>(along with part 2 and 3)&nbsp; to fill the required 30 hours of Anatomy and Physiology training.&nbsp; </p><p>If you are already a yoga teacher- this is a great way to \"fill in the gaps\" if the Yoga Teacher Training you attended did not provide in depth information about the body. </p><p>I&nbsp;am am certified through both <strong>Yoga Alliance</strong> and the <strong>International Association of Yoga Therapists</strong> as a continuing education provider.&nbsp; Continuing education credits (non-contact) can be earned through the completion of this course. Upon course completion you will get a certificate from Udemy that you can submit on the Yoga Alliance dashboard. </p><p>This course was recorded <strong>LIVE</strong> as it was delivered over Zoom- so you can hear the students asking questions in real time.&nbsp; I&nbsp;utilize clear visuals in the form of slides that are provided as a downloadable PDF at the beginning of each section. I&nbsp;also utilize the <strong>Complete Anatomy App</strong> for detailed \"virtual dissections\" of the body. The best part is that you can work at your own pace and go back to review any information as needed...an essential part to fully absorbing the complex topic of anatomy. </p><p><strong>The Topics Covered in Part 1 of the \"Anatomy of Yoga\" workshop series are:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>- How yoga interacts with the nervous system</p><p>- The structure of the Neuron - the building block of the Nervous System</p><p>- The Central and Peripheral Nervous system</p><p>- The Vagus Nerve and the Relaxation Response</p><p>- The spinal Nerves</p><p>- Sensory input- the Language of the nervous system</p><p>- The Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Nervous System</p><p>- How to activate the Relaxation Response</p><p>- Introduction to Polyvagal Theory</p><p>- The Sensory System and Sensory Diet Techniques</p><p>- The Respiratory System and how it interacts with Yoga</p><p>- The Core Muscles</p><p>- The Digestive System &amp;&nbsp;how it interacts with Yoga</p><p>- The Cardiovascular System and how it interacts with Yoga</p><p>- The Lymphatic System and how it interacts with yoga</p><p>- The Immune System and how Yoga supports proper function </p><p>- The Urinary system and how yoga interacts with it</p><p>- The endocrine System and how it relates to the Subtle Body and Chakra System</p><p>- Psychology as it relates to the endocrine system</p><p>- Yoga Injury Prevention</p><p>- Utilizing Exercise Science to build resilience</p><p>- Alignment considerations in Yoga Safety</p><p>- Common Yoga Injuries and how to Prevent Them</p><p><br></p><p>These videos total <strong>over 10 hours of coursework </strong>and include 5 slide shows as detailed downloadable PDF resources. The remainder of coursework for the \"Anatomy of Yoga\" workshop series will be covered in the next segments of the course. </p><p><strong>Each topic is discussed with a focus on how it relates directly to yoga practice. </strong></p><p>The information is conveyed in a way that is applicable to what you do as a yoga teacher and how you can utilize this information to better meet the needs of your students. </p><p><strong>Thank you for your interest in my course- I&nbsp;look forward to sharing my love of Yoga &amp;&nbsp;Anatomy with you!</strong></p><p><strong>I hope you will join me on this journey to creating a generation of confident, well-educated &amp;&nbsp;effective Yoga Teachers!</strong></p><p>________________________________________________</p><p><strong>Questions</strong>?

This means, instead of having to learn Objective-C or Swift to build iOS apps, and Java, or Kotlin to build Android apps, you can now use Flutter Mobile Development Framework to build apps that run natively on both iOS and Android devices using the <strong>General-purpose Dart Programming Language.</strong></p><p><strong>By learning Flutter App Development, you'll be able to build iOS and Android apps with a single codebase!&nbsp; </strong>This course is the ultimate <strong>Flutter tutorial </strong>created for those who want to build cross-platform iOS and Android mobile apps using the Dart Programming language.</p><p><br></p><p>This course is fully hands-on, in which you'll get the chance to practice and learn:</p><ul><li><p>Dart Programming Language - Fundamentals and intermediate topics</p></li><li><p>How to understand Flutter Mobile Development by building apps incrementally.</p></li><li><p>How to design, build, debug Flutter Android and iOS Apps</p></li><li><p>How to get Flutter apps to communicate with a realtime database - Firestore</p></li><li><p>How to build robust apps with Flutter.</p></li></ul><p><strong>You’ll see how easy it’s to get started building Android and iOS apps using Google’s Flutter App Development Framework!</strong></p><p>The course is structured in such a way to improve your knowledge retention - by having a lot of hands-on projects.&nbsp; In each section of the course, you will be practicing and building something meaningful and useful, which will further your understanding of Flutter iOS and Android Development.</p><p>For instance, you'll start by learning the very basics of the <strong>Dart Programming language</strong> (which is the programming language used in Flutter) - you'll learn control flow and functions, how to do arithmetic in Dart, and so forth.&nbsp; </p><p>Next, you'll learn <strong>Object-Oriented Programming in Dart </strong>- understanding how to construct classes and Objects and how it all works when building robust programs.&nbsp; Furthermore, you'll learn intermediate and advanced Dart topics such as Abstract classes, Interfaces, and Data Structures.&nbsp; </p><p>Once you've learned the Dart Programming language, you'll then start with Flutter Mobile Development.&nbsp; You'll start by building small, simple iOS and Android apps using Flutter, such as the Business Card app.&nbsp; Then, we move into the realm of <strong>Stateful Widgets in Flutter</strong> - how to manage state in an App.</p><p>Along the way, we continue to build several fun apps to solidify the main, fundamental Flutter concepts.&nbsp; You'll also have several challenges you need to further dive deeper into understanding Flutter concepts.</p><p>Continuing with the course, you'll also have the opportunity to learn how to parse JSON from a remote API into your Flutter app and cleanly display the parsed data to the user using <strong>Material Design</strong> concepts.&nbsp; Additionally, you'll learn how to connect your app to <strong>Firebase/Firestore</strong> and use a real-time database.</p><p>You'll finish the journey by learning how to package up your Flutter iOS or Android app to publish on either the Appstore or Google Play store.</p><p>The course will take you from zero to hero - from knowing nothing (or a little) about Flutter iOS and Android Mobile development to building complex, stunning mobile applications!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why Should You Take This Course?</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong>My name is Paulo Dichone; I've created the most best-selling online programming courses (<strong>with over 100,000 happy and satisfied students</strong>). </p><p>I'm a Software Engineer, a teacher, and the author of highly rated Development courses on Udemy. I've taught over 100,000 students online and received over 15,000 reviews. Students love my teaching methodology, which is heavy on hands-on, project-based approaches.</p><p>I know how hard it can be to learn programming and Android development - there's a lot of information out there, but the problem is that none is complete, nor is it updated.&nbsp; I understand how frustrating it's to try to learn something on your own and spend months without seeing progress!&nbsp; </p><p><strong>Here's what my current and past students have to say about this course and my other courses:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><em>\"It's a good course for Intermediate Learners...</em></p><p><em>Nice job, Paulo...</em></p><p><em>I've learned a lot from you\" - </em>Collins ★★★★★ (5 stars rating)</p><p><br></p><p><em>Best tutor ever !!!

Moreover the English language used is VERY CLEAR (and I'm italian!) therefore whoever affirms/writes the opposite is clearly in \"bad faith\" (probably \"competition\"?! ). So, completing my review, I believe that anyone who wants to learn Java and do it with an updated course should definitely buy this course.\"</p><p><br></p><p><em>Denys Malik:</em></p><p>\"Great course. It is well-structured and has a big amount of practice. I've got a lot of useful info from it. Thank you.\"</p><p><br></p><p><em>Eslam Abd El-azize Mohamed Mohamed:</em></p><p>\"wow its very cool course\"</p><p><br></p><p><em>Kavindu Harshitha:</em></p><p>\"Best JAVA course highly recommended Thank you for this course\"</p><p><br></p><p><em>Sabrina Maia Quirino:</em></p><p>\"Teaches incredibly well, he makes it easy to understand!\"</p><p><br></p><p><em>Dayana Pergament:</em></p><p>\"The teacher explains every little details. I love learning from him thank you so much for this\"</p><p><br></p><p><em>Ishan Kapoor:</em></p><p>\"GREAT TEACHER WITH GREAT TEACHING STYLE!!\"</p><p><br></p><p>And thousands of other reviews and happy students!</p><p><br></p><p>Before starting the creation of this course, our team attentively investigated feedbacks for existing courses on the Udemy platform and tried to focus on the feedbacks for the top-rated courses to understand what can be improved in this course and make it, even more, better from the quality standpoint. After analysis, we understand what will help students to learn Java in a more efficient way. In this course:</p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching other 30 minutes lessons. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Only your homework and coding exercises including the EXAM&nbsp;task might take approximately 20 hours to implement.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 18 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. </p><p><strong>- Sequence of lessons</strong></p><p>After the years of teaching offline, and based on the feedback of students who are passing online courses we realized how important the sequence of lessons is while teaching Java. The same issue is with the books where information is completely unstructured what makes things even more complex. For example, how students can learn object-oriented programming from the first lesson if they don't know yet the java syntax basics?&nbsp;Or how a student can implement a home task if he/she doesn't aware of java methods specifics, or doesn't know yet how to read program input?</p><p>So in this course, you can be sure, that you will not get a home task to implement without having enough information to implement it. The program which is in this course is proven by many students who completed it offline and now work as software engineers in outsourcing companies and as freelancers.</p><p><strong>- Interview practice tests<br><br></strong>Being an IT consultant in different companies, the tutor of this course was in charge of driving the interview process in companies to make sure, that company selects the best people. That's why the first interview is always test. In case the test is completed, the candidate is invited to have a conversation. That's why in this course we want to prepare you to complete tests successfully! </p><p>Especially for our students, we prepared tests that could be used to evaluate their knowledge during the interview process. </p><p>2 tests. 90 questions each <strong>(180 interview tests in total). </strong>120 minutes each.</p><p>You can read explanations for answers! That also can help you to learn the material better. Don't wait, try it now!</p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support</strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning processes is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concepts or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong></p><p><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.</p><p><strong>- Coding exercises </strong></p><p>To learn to program is not enough just watching videos and reading books. You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will have different practical tasks which will help you learn and understand Java better. </p><p>One of the key tasks where you can practice your knowledge is the implementation of a backend system for an online store. Also, you have a lot of tasks that use domain-specific terminology:&nbsp;accounts, transactions, users, carts, menu, services, etc. So that means you are learning programming without abstract concepts like it is written in the books or in other courses. You learn domain-specific terminology and during the lessons, we investigate specific extracts from code that can give you a clear vision of how you can apply the knowledge in real life.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait! Take a look at the lessons' preview if you still have doubts! </p><p><strong><em>Buy this course today, and you will get all updates for FREE! </em></strong></p><p>Right now our team keeps working on the next lessons for this course. We are preparing for you a lot of other topics and coding exercises! Our goal - to create a web application together with you. Buy this course today, and you will receive all updates for free! Isn't that cool?&nbsp;:) </p><p><br></p><p>For those who successfully passed this training course, or for students who were recognized for asking amazing questions, there is a special offer from the IT-Bulls company! The creator of this course is IT-Bulls company CEO&nbsp;and Founder. We are always in search of talents to run our amazing startups together with you. Probably you always dreamed about running your own startup?&nbsp;In this course, you will be able to find the team who will teach you how to do that and (in particular cases) will be glad to help with implementation! </p><p>Hope you enjoy this course! And remember, we appreciate all your feedback! Your feedback will help us to become even better!&nbsp;Your feedback will help us to create to best Java course ever! </p><p>See you at the lessons!&nbsp;:)</p><p><br></p>",

    "description": "<p>The Rust programming language is a boon for systems programmers because of its powerful and expressive type system and strict compile-time static analysis. Still, there are best practices to follow and idioms that the community has developed over time. This course tackles testing, building and distributing applications, and other real-world challenges using Rust, Cargo, and the Rustup toolchain manager.</p><p>You will build four projects, including a search tool, a Markdown parser, a chat server and client, and a blog. In this course, we’ll progress from command line applications, built with proper command line argument parsing and error handling, to more complex applications like a GUI text editor and several web applications. We’ll explore asynchronous programming and concurrent programming in Rust using real-world scenarios like file searching and stress testing. Finally, we’ll build a simple web app that interacts with a database in a type-safe manner using Diesel.</p><p>By the end of the course, you will be adept with the knowledge of Rust to practically implement it in real-world projects. You’ll know enough to build high-quality software that can be shared with the rest of the Rust community or even used in production.</p><p><strong>About the Author</strong></p><p><strong>Matthew Stoodley</strong> is a programming expert and enthusiast and was drawn to learn about Rust and master its features initially due to its low power usage and memory safety capabilities. He primarily uses Rust to build board games. In addition, he also possesses several years of experience in Go, PHP, and JavaScript among many others.</p>",

    "CourseName": "Building Web Applications with Go - Intermediate Level",
    "description": "<p>This course is the followup to Building Modern Web Applications in Go. In this course, we go further than we did the first time around. We will build a sample E-Commerce application that consists of multiple, separate applications:&nbsp;a <strong>front end</strong> (which services content to the end user as web pages); a <strong>back end API </strong>(which is called by the front end as necessary), and a <strong>microservice</strong> that performs only one task, but performs it extremely well (dynamically building PDF invoices and sending them to customers as an email attachment).</p><p>The application will sell individual items, as well as allow users to purchase a monthly subscription. All credit card transactions will be processed through <strong>Stripe</strong>, which is arguably one of the most popular payment processing systems available today, and for good reason:&nbsp;developers love it. Stripe offers a rich API (application programming interface), and it is available in more than 35 countries around the world, and works with more than 135 currencies. Literally millions of organizations and businesses use Stripe’s software and APIs to accept payments, send payouts, and manage their businesses online with the Stripe dashboard. However, in many cases, developers want to be able to build a more customized solution, and not require end users to log in to both a web application and the Stripe dashboard. That is precisely the kind of thing that we will be covering in this course.</p><p>We will start with a simple <strong>Virtual Terminal,</strong> which can be used to process so-called \"card not present\" transactions. This will be a fully functional web application, built from the ground up on <strong>Go </strong>(sometimes referred to as Golang). The front end will be rendered using Go's rich html/template package, and authenticated users will be able to process credit card payments from a secure form, integrated with the Stripe API. In this section of the course, we will cover the following:</p><ul><li><p>How to build a secure, production ready web application in Go</p></li><li><p>How to capture the necessary information for a secure online credit card transaction</p></li><li><p>How to call the Stripe API from a Go back end to create a paymentIntent (Stripe's object for authorizing and making a transaction)</p></li></ul><p>Once we have that out of the way, we'll build a second web application in the next section of the course, consisting of a simple web site that allows users to purchase a product, or purchase a monthly subscription. Again, this will be a web application built from the ground up in Go. In this section of the course, we'll cover the following:</p><ul><li><p>How to allow users to purchase a single product</p></li><li><p>How to allow users to purchase a recurring monthly subscription (a Stripe Plan)</p></li><li><p>How to handle cancellations and refunds</p></li><li><p>How to save all transaction information to a database (for refunds, reporting, etc).</p></li><li><p>How to refund a transaction</p></li><li><p>How to cancel a subscription</p></li><li><p>How to secure access to the front end (via session authentication)</p></li><li><p>How to secure access to the back end API&nbsp;(using stateful tokens)</p></li><li><p>How to manage users (add/edit/delete)</p></li><li><p>How to allow users to reset their passwords safely and securely</p></li><li><p>How to log a user out and cancel their account instantly, over websockets</p></li></ul><p>Once this is complete, we'll start work on the microservice. A microservice is a particular approach to software development that has the basic premise of building very small applications that do one thing, but do it very well. A microservice does not care in the slightest about what application calls it; it is completely separate, and completely agnostic. We'll build a microserivce that does the following:</p><ul><li><p>Accepts a JSON payload describing an individual purchase</p></li><li><p>Produces a PDF invoice with information from the JSON payload</p></li><li><p>Creates an email to the customer, and attaches the PDF to it</p></li><li><p>Sends the email</p></li></ul><p>All of these components (front end, back end, and microservice) will be built using a single code base that produces&nbsp; multiple binaries, using Gnu Make.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

Sometimes, this is referred to as sound typing. Although types are mandatory, type annotations are optional because of type inference. The Dart typing system is also flexible, allowing the use of a dynamic type combined with runtime checks, which can be useful during experimentation or for code that needs to be especially dynamic.<strong><br>What is Google Flutter?</strong></p><p>Flutter is Google’s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

Flutter is composed of three architectural layers: the Flutter framework, which is written in Dart and provides all the widgets that developers use to build their apps; the Flutter Engine, written in C++, which provides low-level rendering support with Google’s Skia; and the platform-specific Embedder, which talks directly to the operating system.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why did Google create Flutter?</strong></p><p>Flutter, first known as “Sky”, was announced in 2015 with Android support only. It was created to provide a better mobile experience for users and developers, taking the best parts of the web development experience, and bringing them to mobile. Its main goals were high-performance and portability across multiple platforms. While other cross-platform solutions such as React Native and Xamarin were already popular, they could not deliver the same fidelity and performance as apps built with the native iOS and Android SDKs. Flutter changed that by making it possible to create beautiful, performant apps across multiple platforms with a single codebase.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Is Flutter in demand?</strong></p><p>Flutter has been a production-ready, stable product on iOS and Android since its official launch in December 2018. Big companies such as eBay, BMW, Alibaba, and Toyota are using Flutter as the core framework for their mobile app development strategy. Over a hundred thousand Flutter apps have already been published on the App Store and Play Store. After overtaking React Native in Google Search trends, Flutter is now the fastest growing software project on GitHub. By choosing Flutter, companies can deliver mobile apps in record-time as they no longer have to build separate apps to support iOS and Android. This makes Flutter an ideal choice for startups, agencies, and small businesses, and as a result, the job market for Flutter developers is also expanding rapidly.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Is Flutter a programming language?</strong></p><p><strong>Flutter is not a language</strong>, rather an SDK just like Android SDK. For android development Java/Kotlin are the programming languages, for cross-platform development using flutter, DART is the official programming language.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Is Flutter a frontend or backend?</strong></p><p><strong>Flutter</strong> is a popular <strong>frontend </strong>development framework from Google that enables developers to build beautiful frontends for any screen. Flutter is designed to streamline cross-platform app development while maintaining a consistent user experience.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Which language is used for Flutter?</strong></p><p>Flutter apps are written in the <strong>Dart language</strong> and make use of many of the language's more advanced features. While writing and debugging an application, Flutter runs in the Dart virtual machine, which features a just-in-time execution engine.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Is Flutter a framework?</strong></p><p><strong>Flutter is an open source framework by Google</strong> for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is Dart and why does Flutter use it?</strong></p><p>Flutter uses Dart as <strong>Dart allows Flutter to avoid the need for a separate declarative layout language like JSX and XML</strong>. The layout of Dart is declarative and programmatic and it makes it easy for developers to read and visualize it very easily and effortlessly.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Is Flutter written in Dart?</strong></p><p><strong>Flutter apps are written in the Dart language</strong> and make use of many of the language's more advanced features. While writing and debugging an application, Flutter runs in the Dart virtual machine, which features a just-in-time execution engine.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Who uses Dart programming language?</strong></p><p>Companies that use the Dart language include <strong>Google, Mews, Ag Flow, and Blossom</strong> to name a few. People generally find that Dart is one of the languages that are easier to grasp, as it is fairly similar to many other programming languages.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What applications use Flutter?</strong></p><p>There are social networking apps for creating and sharing content, dating, and connecting people through events and real-life activities that use Flutter. Alibaba made a shopping app called Xianyu, which has more than 50MM downloads and more than 10MM active users every day. Nubank is the largest independent digital bank outside Asia, and its mobile apps are built with Flutter. Another shopping app is HuYu, which rewards users with gift cards and vouchers for sharing shopping receipts. You can also find music apps for recording and learning to read music. The Hamilton Musical and the famous Abby Road Studios created apps with Flutter. There are apps for sports, finance, fitness, education, animal adoption, mapped gas stations to compare prices, and a travel app. A Google Ads app helps mobile app customers track their ads. Users can view statistics, update bids and budgets, and get real-time notifications.<strong><br><br><br>Google</strong> <strong>Flutter provides higher quality for multi-platform development.<br>Flutter apps use a single codebase, allowing faster time-to-market.<br>Flutter allows you to build beautiful apps easily.<br>Flutter widgets make it easy to build beautiful UIs.<br>The Dart programming language is very productive.<br>Flutter delivers an excellent developer experience with hot reload.<br>Flutter is open source.<br>Flutter comes with a mature ecosystem.<br>Flutter’s unique advantages make it a very strong UI framework on mobile, web, and desktop.<br><br></strong>This course will get you up and running quickly, and teach you the core knowledge you need to deeply understand and build dart flutter programming thus, <strong>we will have prepared a strong foundation for Flutter applications.</strong></p><p>This course is for beginners.

    "description": "<p><strong>With this course, we empower developers worldwide and unite them in a great community!</strong></p><p><strong>Get started with app development with Flutter<br></strong>This course goes far beyond the basics and differs from other courses in that you learn really professional app development based on years of Flutter Freelancer experience.</p><p><strong>We'll show you what really matters in a project. </strong>- Not only how to build a cool UI...<br>We learn how to build a software architecture that is maintainable, scalable and efficient. Here you will learn the things that will accompany you throughout your career and really help you as a clear concept for the architecture of your software, the testing and how we deal with dependencies.</p><p><strong>Don't worry - there's something for everyone here. <br></strong>Whether you're an experienced developer or a complete beginner - We'll meet you at your level of experience and abstraction and guide you by the hand from the first small Flutter App to professional software architecture, functional programming, testing and much more.</p><p><strong>In this still young framework, there are few people who are really good</strong>. <br>This means there are many possibilities here. With the ever-increasing number of apps implemented with the Flutter Framework, so does the demand for capable developers. And you can become one of them!</p><p>Also: Flutter and the Dart language are great, really fun to develop and play around with!</p><p><strong>Flutter Community</strong> <br>We already have the largest active German Flutter Community on our own Discord server. Now we want to create also a server for the Englisch Community where you can exchange ideas with other developers and support each other. We look forward to having you with us too!</p><p><br><br><strong>✅&nbsp; UP TO DATE:<em> </em></strong><em>The course and all projects were last updated in December 2022.</em></p><p><strong>✅&nbsp; Latest Update - Flutter Version:<em> </em></strong><em>3.3.9</em></p><p><strong>✅&nbsp; Course Compatible with Flutter Version </strong><em>2.5 +</em></p><p><strong><br><br>What will we learn?<br></strong><br><strong>Content:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Basic course Dart </strong>- basics of programming</p></li><li><p><strong>Basic course Flutter </strong>- basics of app development with Flutter</p></li><li><p><strong>Clean architecture </strong>- professional development with Flutter</p></li><li><p><strong>Testing</strong> - unit testing, widget testing, golden tests, integration testing<br></p></li></ul><p><strong>⭐️ Dart Basics</strong></p><p>In this course you will first get to know the basics of programming in Dart. We will also dive into the essential parts of programming using Dart language and we will learn how to set up our development environment and deal with the Code Editor VS Code. We'll start with the basic knowledge of what a variable actually is and then work our way up to object orientation and asynchronous programming.<br><br><strong>⭐️ Flutter Basics</strong></p><p>Here we'll give you an introduction to the most important elements of UI creation with the Flutter Framework and teach you all&nbsp; you need to write your own user interfaces for your apps. From the explanation of how the framework works, to the use of individual UI components, themes, animations, navigation and much more, everything is included!<br><br><strong>⭐️ Clean Architecture</strong></p><p>Based on a simple app that we will develop, we will learn how proper app development with <strong>clean software architecture</strong> works. </p><p>We will implement this small and simple app with a bulletproof clean code software architecture (<strong>clean layer separation</strong>), which<strong> you can use for any customer app</strong>. Once you have internalized this architecture and type of work, your software will achieve extremely high quality standards. We integrate the BLoC pattern into our project and thus cleanly separate business logic from UI, so we have a very clean and testable project.<strong> Dependency injection</strong> and <strong>functional programming </strong>are just a few tools that will support us on our way. Of course, we will also cover <strong>unit testing, widget testing and integration testing</strong> to check our app for everything.<br><br></p><p><strong><em>❗️ </em>Important: </strong>In this course, we aim to give you all the knowledge you need to start app development with Flutter quickly and effectively. We are not too \"obsessed with details\" and will not go into all the complex background processes that you are taught in an university course, for example. Rather we will dive into praxis as soon as possible.</p><p><strong>Our focus is on practicality, quality and - last but not least- fun.</strong></p><p><br></p>",

In the first couple of days, you’ll learn to install Rust on your system, discover its syntax, and see a library that utilizes the feature of trait-based generics and code reusability.&nbsp;</p><p>On days 3 and 4, you’ll understand how Rust Lifetimes work by doing extensive compiler checking and learn to make your programs more interactive by accessing all the bits of the Rust environment. On day 5, you’ll learn about multithreading without data races with safe concurrency. Day 6, you’ll create a database, using your code to read and update while securing it with Bcrypt from various breaches such as SQL injection attacks.&nbsp;</p><p>By the end of the course, you’ll have built a mini-bank application that tracks users’ financial transactions over time, allowing them to view their history over time.</p><p><strong>About the Author</strong></p><p><strong>Matthew Stoodley</strong> is a programming enthusiast and has been really excited to learn about Rust for it’s low level power and memory safety.

All of the project files can be found on <strong>my github page</strong>.</p><p>Also, the series was carefully monitored by the amazing creator of bloc_library, Felix Angelov.</p><p>On the other hand, without <strong>without the slightest restraint</strong> I feel like my series is <strong>the best bloc_library playlist</strong> on the entire internet. </p><p><strong>Don't take my word for it, try it by yourself!</strong></p><p>A briefing of everything that's been covered in this playlist, so you know what to expect:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Why BLoC?</strong> In this video I explained why I chose bloc_library for both the state management solution and the architectural structure of my apps</p></li><li><p><strong>BLoC Core Concepts</strong> - In this tutorial I got really in-depth in explaining <strong>streams</strong>, and the concepts of <strong>blocs</strong> &amp; <strong>cubits.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Flutter BLoc Concepts</strong> - Here, I discussed each and every single one of bloc_library's concept like <strong>BlocProvider, BlocBuilder, BlocListener</strong> and many many more. These concepts are obviously explained and tested in every tutorial, since they are the base of bloc_library.</p></li><li><p><strong>BLoC Architecture -</strong> In this tutorial I made a short introduction on what I believe it's the best <strong>architecture</strong> to follow in order to structure and scale your code over time! This video has no code inside my github page, since I'm planning on using it extensively on my follow-up tutorial series on building real world apps!</p></li><li><p><strong>BLoC Testing</strong> - Testing is one of the most important pillars of programming, oftenly omitted by developers. In this video I'll explain what are the basics of <strong>testing</strong> a bloc-built small application.</p></li><li><p><strong>BLoC Access &amp; Navigation</strong> - In this tutorial I got really in-depth on what are the <strong>routing options</strong> on which you can successfully provide a cubit/bloc to the widget tree.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bloc-to-bloc Communication</strong> - Here I wanted all my viewers to understand how important it is to know how to <strong>make 2 blocs/cubit communicate one</strong> with another.</p></li><li><p><strong>BuildContext In-Depth</strong> - This tutorial is not really related to the bloc_library, but since build contexts are used everywhere inside a flutter app, I realised that most of people didn't understand how they really work. This video is also useful as it spreads out the knowledge gained from <strong>tutorial number 3 and 6</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bloc 6.1.0</strong> - During my tutorial series, a new version of bloc_library got released, containing some important changes like context.watch, context.read and context.select. All of these are covered in this video, as always, with intuitive examples.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bloc State not Updating</strong> - In this video, I explained why most of the new developers encounter this popular issue of a state of a <strong>bloc/cubit not updating</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Maintaining State with Hydrated_Bloc</strong> - In this tutorial I got really in-depth about how you can store the state of multiple blocs/cubits on the app's internal storage on your device. This is a key concept in developing a successful Flutter app, having bloc_library as the state management feature.</p></li><li><p><strong>Debugging Blocs/Cubits, Naming Conventions and other tips and tricks</strong> is the last video of this series, covering other important topics found inside the flutter_bloc library.</p></li></ol><p>Thank you and hopefully you are as excited as I am!</p><p>WCKD</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>Have you tried to learn JavaScript before?</strong></p>\n<p>JavaScript is the most popular programming language out there, but that doesn’t mean it’s easy to learn. You end up wasting time on out-of-date courses and incomplete YouTube tutorials that talk about a JavaScript features without showing how to use them when building real-world applications.</p>\n<p>Sound familiar?</p>\n<p><strong>I built this course to teach you how to build and launch your own JavaScript web applications. </strong></p>\n<p>The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp starts from scratch and builds up your knowledge of the JavaScript language. Yes, you’ll learn all the features of the language, but you’ll also learn how to use those features together to create a complete application.</p>\n<p>This comprehensive course covers the modern ES6 and&nbsp;ES7 JavaScript features used in the real world. You’ll gain an understanding of the latest cutting-edge language features. </p>\n<p>Getting experience writing code on your own is a big part of learning JavaScript. <strong>That’s why I’ve included over 80 challenges designed to get you writing code, adding app features, and solving a wide range of problems.</strong> These challenges will give you the skills and confidence needed to create your own web application.</p>\n<p>There are no starter projects here. You’ll see what it takes to launch a JavaScript application, from the first line of code to the final deployed application.</p>\n<p><strong>Who’s this course for?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. People who are brand new to JavaScript. </strong>You want to dive into the world of programming and learn JavaScript. This might be your first programming course, or maybe you’ve worked with other languages before. Either way, you’re ready for this bootcamp.</p>\n<p><strong>2. People who currently use JavaScript but want a better sense of mastery over the language. </strong>You picked up little tricks and snippets of code because you needed to solve a problem. Now you’re ready to master JavaScript as well as explore the latest from ES6 and ES7.</p>\n<p><strong>You’ll learn JavaScript by doing, not watching.</strong></p>\n<p>This course is not about watching videos, it’s about writing code. From the start, you’ll be building out each project from scratch as well as completing over 80 challenges designed to test and reinforce what you’ve learned.</p>\n<p>During the class, you’ll build three JavaScript applications:</p>\n<p>1. The first app, a note-taking app, is our starter application. You’ll learn the fundamentals of JavaScript and see exactly what it takes to build a program that allows users to add, edit, delete, and save their notes.</p>\n<p>2. The second app, a to-do application, you’ll be building on your own. This will test your skills and ensure that you have the real-world experience and problem-solving skills that are essential for writing JavaScript code.</p>\n<p>3. The last app, a hangman word game, is used to explore the world of asynchronous JavaScript. You’ll learn how to set up applications that rely on data from third-party services that can offer up dynamic, real-time information such as the user’s current location.</p>\n<p><strong>Stay current in an ever changing world.</strong></p>\n<p>The world of JavaScript is always changing, and that’s why I work to keep this course as up-to-date as possible. You can join knowing you’ll be learning the fundamentals of the language as well as the new language features that keep coming out.</p>\n<p>This course uses the latest language features from ES6 and ES7.</p>\n<p><strong>Everything you need comes in one easy-to-use package.</strong></p>\n<p>There’s no need to worry if you’re learning the right skills to land that JavaScript job or launch that JavaScript app. I’ve mapped out everything you need to know in an interactive, easy-to-follow package designed to get you up and running in a couple of weeks.</p>\n<p>By the end, you’ll be able to build and launch your own applications.</p>\n<p><strong>There’s no better time to learn JavaScript.</strong></p>\n<p>You’ve made a smart choice, because JavaScript is the most popular programming language out there. This is no exaggeration. This popularity and growth means more jobs and opportunities than ever before.</p>\n<p>JavaScript powers the web. That means every company out there uses JavaScript, and the demand for JavaScript developers is only increasing. Companies from Google and Apple to Udemy itself all use JavaScript extensively. </p>\n<p>JavaScript doesn’t stop with the web. It has quickly become a universal programming language capable of anything. JavaScript can be used to create desktop apps, server-side applications, native iOS/Android applications, and so much more. This course is your ticket into that ecosystem. </p>\n<p><strong>Get access to fast support if you get stuck.</strong></p>\n<p>There’s nothing worse than getting stuck ten hours into a course and not getting the help you need to continue. Getting stuck is part of the learning process. That’s why I’m here to answer every single question that comes my way.</p>\n<p>I’ll work with you to get you unstuck and back on track. It’s one of the reasons students love taking my courses. Don’t take my word for it. Check out the student reviews below.</p>\n<p><em>“This is the absolute best course I've taken on Udemy.

    "CourseName": "Building a module in Go (Golang)",
    "description": "<p>Working with web applications in Go is remarkably easy, but it does not take too long to realize that in a lot of cases, we end up writing the same kind of code every time we start a new project. You might need to read JSON, write JSON, upload files, or any of the commonly used features of a given web application. In other words, we often rewrite code that we have already written, many times over.</p><p>Rather than simply copying and pasting code from one project to another, it makes sense to take advantage of Go modules -- reusable code that can be included in a project by simply issuing a \"go get\" command. That way, if new functionality is added to that module, any project that imports it can take advantage of that functionality simply by updating its dependencies, and if a bug is discovered, you can fix it by updating the module; every project that uses that module gets the bug fix with a single \"go get -u\"&nbsp;command.</p><p>Building a robust, secure, well-tested module is not difficult, but it does require careful planning to ensure that it will work across different operating systems.</p><p>This course will take you through the steps necessary to produce a module that includes many of the tasks commonly used in web applications, including:<br></p><ul><li><p>reading JSON</p></li><li><p>writing JSON</p></li><li><p>producing well formatted, informative error messages</p></li><li><p>uploading one or more files to a server, and limiting uploads by mime type and file size</p></li><li><p>creating directories on the server</p></li><li><p>generating random strings</p></li><li><p>downloading static files</p></li><li><p>posting JSON to a remote service</p></li><li><p>creating a URL safe slug from a string</p></li></ul><p>We'll build our module using Go 1.18's new workspaces tools, and we'll ensure that the entire module is well-tested.</p><p>Our final module will not have any external dependencies, and will only use functionality found in Go's standard library.</p><p>By the time you have finished this course, you'll have a Go module that will make starting a new web application much faster, and you won't be depending on someone else's code to do so.</p>",

It is still one of the more popular programming languages, used for creating high performance applications across a wide variety of domains &amp;&nbsp;platforms.</p><p>In 2011, C++11 was born. This revision added lot of new features to the language and it got a new name, Modern C++. This emphasizes writing C++ code using modern features of the language such as move semantics, automatic type inference, threading, lambda expressions, smart pointers and a lot more. C++11 was followed by C++14, that added even more features and enhanced existing ones. C++17 released in 2017 added a filesystem library (covered in the course), parallel versions of STL algorithms, new library types such as std::optional, std::any and more.</p><p>This course teaches C++ as an object oriented language with modern features. It focuses on teaching C++&nbsp;concepts, both&nbsp;old and new, with clear examples. It builds upon the basic language facilities that are then used to build more complex programs with classes, operator overloading, composition, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, concurrency, etc. It&nbsp;even digs deep into assembly to understand few concepts better.&nbsp;After every few topics, a quiz is presented that tests your understanding of the previous topics.

By learning the bigger things in Javascript, you will be able to know how to put the remaining pieces together and will be able to get into advanced courses more prepared.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; <strong>I'm not going to start this course with False promises.</strong>&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At the end of this course, you will NOT become an expert and nor will you in any other course. To become an expert in Javascript or any other programming language you need many hours of practice and experience; more like years of practice and experience.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; <strong>My PROMISE to you.</strong>&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My promise to you is that all the lessons you will see here, will get engraved in your brain better than in any other course, why? My approach is the practice approach which is the number one key to learning any programming language or technical course faster and easier.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; <strong>I created a small practice application for you inside the exercise files. </strong>At the end of every section, we will jump into this small application together, and practice everything we covered in the past lectures. This approach will make sure that you can retain the information you learned longer.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My goal is to help you understand the major components and prepare you for advanced courses</strong>, in this way you can transition to the language easier.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Once you know the major parts of the Javascript language, everything else will be very easy to learn, and that is exactly what this course will provide you.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With years of programming experience invested in this course, you can rest assured that the information supplied in this course will prepare you to jump into any advanced Javascript course and come out on top.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Commonly Asked Questions.....&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Q: Is Javascript easy?&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A: Yes and no&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It depends on the teacher and the student. Learning Javascript is like learning a regular language, you need the major components and then you can start putting everything together. Students that jump into advanced Javascript courses might get confused and take longer to learn the language if they are not prepared with the major concepts.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This course's approach is to teach you the major components not just by watching but also practicing after every section so that you get an understanding of the overall logic of the Javascript language. I find this approach to be better than jumping into an advanced course that will confuse you and leave clueless not knowing what to next, and this is why I built this crash course.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Q: Can I actually make money with Javascript?&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A: Yes and yes.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The market for Javascript is enormous and is in demand right now in any part of the world.

The design and implementations are by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike and Ken Thompson.</p><p>Go is a very good choice for learning a programming language because it was developed by some of the same people who created the C programming language, Unix, and UTF-8 - some of the most influential contributions to computer science. With Go Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson created a modern programming language that can easily run on multiple processors in parallel, works smoothly in different environments, and makes it easy for programmers to write programs with a very streamlined and user-friendly syntax.</p><p><strong>Why did Google develop a new programming language?</strong></p><p>In Google's words, \"<em>Go was born out of frustration with existing languages and environments for systems programming. Programming had become too difficult and the choice of languages was partly to blame. One had to choose either </em></p><ul><li><p><em>efficient compilation, </em></p></li><li><p><em>efficient execution, or </em></p></li><li><p><em>ease of programming; </em></p></li></ul><p><em>all three were not available in the same mainstream language. Programmers who could were choosing ease over safety and efficiency by moving to dynamically typed languages such as Python and JavaScript rather than C++ or, to a lesser extent, Java. Go is an attempt to combine the ease of programming of an interpreted, dynamically typed language with the efficiency and safety of a statically typed, compiled language. It also aims to be modern, with support for networked and multicore computing. </em></p><p><em>Finally, working with Go is intended to be fast: it should take at most a few seconds to build a large executable on a single computer. To meet these goals required addressing a number of linguistic issues: an expressive but lightweight type system; concurrency and garbage collection; rigid dependency specification; and so on. These cannot be addressed well by libraries or tools; a new language was called for.</em>\"</p><p>In my humble opinion, Go is the best programming language you can learn today. I've worked with a few programming languages since I was introduced to programming through BASIC in the mid-80s, and Go is by far the best-designed language I've ever used.</p><p>Join learning one of the best programming languages ever designed. You will get knowledge, ideas, concepts, inspiration, quizzes, and code samples to learn to create software and applications yourself according to your needs.<br><br><em>* Check Udemy's Terms and Conditions for details.</em></p>",

Flutter is composed of three architectural layers: the Flutter framework, which is written in Dart and provides all the widgets that developers use to build their apps; the Flutter Engine, written in C++, which provides low-level rendering support with Google’s Skia; and the platform-specific Embedder, which talks directly to the operating system.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why did Google create Flutter?</strong></p><p>Flutter, first known as “Sky”, was announced in 2015 with Android support only. It was created to provide a better mobile experience for users and developers, taking the best parts of the web development experience, and bringing them to mobile. Its main goals were high-performance and portability across multiple platforms. While other cross-platform solutions such as React Native and Xamarin were already popular, they could not deliver the same fidelity and performance as apps built with the native iOS and Android SDKs. Flutter changed that by making it possible to create beautiful, performant apps across multiple platforms with a single codebase.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Is Flutter in demand?</strong></p><p>Flutter has been a production-ready, stable product on iOS and Android since its official launch in December 2018. Big companies such as eBay, BMW, Alibaba, and Toyota are using Flutter as the core framework for their mobile app development strategy. Over a hundred thousand Flutter apps have already been published on the App Store and Play Store. After overtaking React Native in Google Search trends, Flutter is now the fastest growing software project on GitHub. By choosing Flutter, companies can deliver mobile apps in record-time as they no longer have to build separate apps to support iOS and Android. This makes Flutter an ideal choice for startups, agencies, and small businesses, and as a result, the job market for Flutter developers is also expanding rapidly.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Is Flutter a programming language?</strong></p><p><strong>Flutter is not a language</strong>, rather an SDK just like Android SDK. For android development Java/Kotlin are the programming languages, for cross-platform development using flutter, DART is the official programming language.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Is Flutter a frontend or backend?</strong></p><p><strong>Flutter</strong> is a popular <strong>frontend </strong>development framework from Google that enables developers to build beautiful frontends for any screen. Flutter is designed to streamline cross-platform app development while maintaining a consistent user experience.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Which language is used for Flutter?</strong></p><p>Flutter apps are written in the <strong>Dart language</strong> and make use of many of the language's more advanced features. While writing and debugging an application, Flutter runs in the Dart virtual machine, which features a just-in-time execution engine.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Is Flutter a framework?</strong></p><p><strong>Flutter is an open source framework by Google</strong> for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is Dart and why does Flutter use it?</strong></p><p>Flutter uses Dart as <strong>Dart allows Flutter to avoid the need for a separate declarative layout language like JSX and XML</strong>. The layout of Dart is declarative and programmatic and it makes it easy for developers to read and visualize it very easily and effortlessly.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Is Flutter written in Dart?</strong></p><p><strong>Flutter apps are written in the Dart language</strong> and make use of many of the language's more advanced features.

Alibaba made a shopping app called Xianyu, which has more than 50MM downloads and more than 10MM active users every day. Nubank is the largest independent digital bank outside Asia, and its mobile apps are built with Flutter.

    "description": "<p><strong>Just Updated for 2023!</strong> Become a Fullstack Web Developer by learning the most in demand skills!&nbsp; <strong>Graduates of this course are now working at companies like Google, Tesla, Amazon, Apple, Shopify, JP Morgan, Facebook + other top tech companies (...seriously).</strong></p><p><strong>Join a live online community of over 900,000+ developers and a course taught by an industry expert that has actually worked both in Silicon Valley and Toronto as a Senior Developer and Tech Lead. </strong><br><br>This is <em>the</em> tutorial you've been looking for to <strong>become a modern web developer in 2023.&nbsp;</strong>It doesn’t just cover a small portion of the industry. This covers everything you need to know to get hired: from absolute zero knowledge to being able to put things on your resume that will allow you to live the life you want.&nbsp;</p><p>Sounds too good to be true? Give me 5 minutes of your time to explain why I built this Web&nbsp;Development course and what is different here than thousands of other courses all over the internet:</p><ol><li><p><strong>I update the course every month to make sure you learn the most up to date skills! </strong>There is no wasted time here. We won’t be using outdated technologies like PHP, Wordpress and JQuery. Although still useful, outdated technologies like the above are low paying and demands for them are decreasing. In this course, you will learn the specific technologies that are the most in demand in the industry right now. These include <strong>tools and technologies used by the biggest tech companies like Google, Facebook, Instagram, etc… It is geared specifically for people that want to learn employable skills in 2023.<br><br></strong></p></li><li><p>After finishing this course, you will be able to apply for developer roles, get a promotion, or upgrade your job title as a developer and earn a higher salary. We won't be taking any shortcuts in this course. <strong>You are going to go&nbsp;from absolute zero: where you learn how the internet works. To mastery: where you build an image recognition app using a&nbsp;Machine Learning API (a subset of Artificial Intelligence) and all the other modern technologies that we learn in the course.&nbsp;Most students have commented how the projects in this course have impressed their interviewers and allowed them to get an offer.<br><br></strong></p></li><li><p>This course is taught by an instructor who has worked in Silicon Valley, and one of the top tech companies in Toronto. <strong>I have built large scale applications, and have managed teams of developers. I am not an online marketer or a salesman, but a software developer who has worked directly with these technologies.&nbsp; I love programming and believe that there needs to be a course out there that actually teaches valuable real life skills (because most of them are taught by teachers with no work experience).<br><br></strong></p></li><li><p>Your time is valuable and you don't want to spend thousands of dollars on a bootcamp. You want a course that outlines the best way to become a Web Developer, in simple and well explained terms, so that you fully understand topics instead of watching somebody on your screen and having no clue what is going on.<strong> I have taken the best pieces, tools, and practices that I have found over the years, and condensed everything into this course. 50 hours of videos doesn't mean much if the instructor isn't engaging or focuses on outdated topics.&nbsp;I made sure that everything covered in this course is efficient and focuses on getting you job ready as soon as possible!&nbsp;<br><br></strong></p></li><li><p><strong>We&nbsp;have a thriving online chat community so you really feel like you are part of a classroom and not just watching videos by yourself. </strong>You will have a chance to communicate with fellow students, work on group projects together, and contribute to open source projects. Anytime you have a question, you can ask in many locations and get help right away (including from myself).&nbsp;</p><p><br></p></li><li><p>The course is designed to <strong>give you employable skills so you can get a job</strong>. Here is what one student recently wrote after taking the course and being hired right away: <br><br><em>\"I’m a self taught dev, who has been out of work for ~6 months. I had some family things that came up that prevented me from seeking permanent employment, so for awhile I was Postmates/Uber delivery driver.<br>&nbsp; <br>After taking this course, I immediately got catapulted back to where I was before, but better equipped and with the knowledge to take on the next job. I had just finished the React section when I went to a recent interview, and it really helped me excel. As of today, I am officially re-employed back in the field, and it is all thanks to this course.&nbsp;I had a blast creating the final project, and FINALLY got around to learning SQL statements, and getting to use them in a project. I’m really ecstatic that Andrei went with teaching relational databases over something like MongoDB, which can also be fun, but is less practical for use on the job.&nbsp; &nbsp;So thanks Andrei&nbsp;, I really enjoyed the course and will be making sure to share it with others who find it helpful. I’m also looking forward to the new ES10 content that was recently added, and going through the DB stuff again when I go to build a personal project.\" - J.C.</em></p></li></ol><p><br></p><p>Think of this course like a Web Developer bootcamp. By the end, you will be comfortable using the below skills and you will be able to put them on your resume:</p><ul><li><p><strong>HTML/HTML5</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>CSS/CSS3</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>SemanticUI</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Responsive Design</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Flexbox</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>CSS&nbsp;Grid</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Bootstrap 5</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>DOM Manipulation</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Javascript (including ES6/ES7/ES8/ES9/ES10/ES2020/ES2021/ES2022)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Asynchronous JavaScript</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>HTTP/JSON/AJAX</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>React +&nbsp;Redux + React Hooks</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Git + Github</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Command Line</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Node.js</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Express.js</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>NPM</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>RESTful&nbsp;API Design</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>PostgresSQL</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>SQL</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Authentication</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Authorization</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Scalable Infrastructure</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Security</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Production and Deployment</strong></p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>You will be taken through online videos and exercises where you will be able to do the following things by the end:<br></p><ul><li><p>Build real complex applications and websites</p></li><li><p>Build an image recognition app so you can add it to your portfolio</p></li><li><p>Go into a job interview confident that you understand the fundamental building blocks of web development and the developer trends in 2023</p></li><li><p>Be able to go off on your own and grow your skills as a developer, having built a solid foundation</p></li><li><p>Learn how frontend, servers, and databases communicate and how they all fit together in the eco system</p></li><li><p>Build your own startup landing page</p></li><li><p>Go off and work remotely by being a freelance developer that can bid on projects</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p>This course is the accumulation of all of my years working in the industry, learning, and teaching. There is so much information out there, so many opinions, and so many ways of doing things, that unless you have spent the last few years working with these technologies in a company, you will never fully understand. So this course is the answer to that&nbsp;exact&nbsp;problem for you: How to gain experience when you need experience to get hired? I have gone through thousands of coding books, online tutorials and bootcamps. <strong>Throughout the years I have taken notes on what has worked and what hasn't, and I have created this course to narrow down the most efficient way to learn with the most relevant information.&nbsp;</strong> </p><p><br></p><p>I am 100% confident that you won't find a course like this out there. We're not going to be building simple todo applications&nbsp;and cat image sliders. We are going to learn actual&nbsp;practical skills that will put you into the workforce. Some unique sections that you won't find anywhere else are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>React.js + Redux:</strong>&nbsp;You will learn the library that companies like Netflix, Facebook and Instagram use to build fast, scalable applications.&nbsp;This is one of the highest in-demand skill in the industry.</p></li><li><p><strong>A day in the life of a developer:</strong>&nbsp;What will your day to day look like and what tools will you&nbsp;use?&nbsp;I will take you through a sample day at a tech company.</p></li><li><p><strong>How does the internet actually work?&nbsp;What is the history of these technologies?:</strong>&nbsp;You will actually understand the underlying concepts of the internet, and how the technologies we have now, have come to be where they are.</p></li><li><p><strong>How do you&nbsp;actually deploy a real life app so that it is secure, and won't get hacked?:</strong>&nbsp;How does a real life app get out to the public in a safe and secure way?</p></li><li><p><strong>What is Machine Learning and how you can&nbsp;harness its power:</strong>&nbsp;Whether you have heard about it or not, this is something that you will hear more and more in the coming years. Those who understand the high level concepts and can harness its power will have an advantage.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>What does your developer environment on your computer look like?:</strong>&nbsp;We will be setting up our computers with all the tools necessary of a developer so you can use the same setup when you go work in the industry.</p></li></ul><p>Why do we teach the above? Because in this day and age, <strong>just knowing HTML CSS&nbsp;and Javascript is not good enough, and you won't be able to grow in your role and command a higher salary. You will learn these things because these are the things you should know in 2023 so that you are miles ahead of the rest.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Make this&nbsp;the year that you took a risk, you learned&nbsp;highly in demand skills, you had new experiences, and you received new opportunities. I hope you join me in this journey. <br><br><strong>This is the proudest work I have ever done in my life and I am confident that you won't find a course better than this. </strong><br><br>See you inside!</p><p>\n</p><p><br></p><p>\n<strong>Taught by:\n</strong></p><p><br>\nAndrei is the instructor of the <strong>highest rated Web Development course on Udemy as well as one of the fastest growing. </strong>His graduates have moved on to work for some of the biggest tech companies around the world like Apple, Google, Amazon, JP Morgan, IBM, UNIQLO etc... He has been working as a senior software developer in Silicon Valley and Toronto for many years, and is now taking all that he has learned, to teach programming skills and to help you discover the amazing career opportunities that being a developer allows in life.</p><p>Having been a self taught programmer, he understands that there is an overwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and books that are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper skills. Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp. <strong>Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education material should teach real life skills that are current and they should not waste a student's valuable time.</strong> Having learned important lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to teaching others valuable software development skills in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities.</p><p>Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained. <strong>He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way.</strong></p><p>Taking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.</p><p><strong>See you inside the courses!</strong></p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>WebSockets</strong> are a technology that allows developers to build highly interactive, extremely fast web applications. Since WebSockets are supported by all modern browsers, and have been for years now, there is no reason why they cannot be implemented on any modern web application. This course will show you how to work with WebSockets with Go.</p><p>We will work with two kinds of WebSocket technologies:&nbsp;first, with simple calls directly from our web application to all connected browsers, where all functionality is handled by our application. The web application we'll build is a simple <strong>chat</strong> application, which will allow users to chat back and forth, and will show the list of connected users, updated in real time. </p><p>Next, we'll take advantage of a <strong>Pusher</strong> compatible server (or Pusher itself, if you prefer) and use that server as a message broker between our web application and all connected clients. </p><p>I am a firm believer that learning how to use a particular technology works best when applying it to a real-world situation. All too often, tutorials and courses over simplify what they are trying to teach, and create an artificial environment where things are so simple that what is being taught looks easy enough, but you immediately run into problems when trying to implement it on a more complex project. So, to implement and learn about WebSockets and Pusher, we'll build a web application which <strong>monitors remote servers and hosts</strong>, and notifies us in real-time when a service goes down or comes back up again. We will send notifications in real time using WebSockets (which will update the appropriate content on the pages being viewed by all connected clients), by email, and, as a bonus, we'll also learn how to send notifications using <strong>text messages</strong> (SMS) with&nbsp; <strong>Twilio</strong>.</p>",

Since it's a relatively complex field, there's no actual gold standard yet for how things are practiced, or taught, which can frustrate people who are just trying to learn new things and couldn't connect the dots.</p><p>This is the motivation behind creating this course to help engineers and students learn different aspects of embedded systems by providing high-quality advanced lectures at a relatively low price.</p><p><br></p><p>Master Behind the Scene working;</p><p>created this course because I believe your time is precious, and you shouldn't have to hunt around to get a practical foundation In Embedded System Programming. In this course, you will learn to write your peripheral driver for most commonly used peripherals such as GPIOs, I2C, SPI, USART, etc., and the exciting thing is that you will learn everything from scratch.</p><p>No 3rd party libraries!</p><p>No blind coding!</p><p>Write your driver APIs by dealing with the peripheral registers of the MCU!</p><p>Code and Implement APIs from scratch, diving into the datasheet and reference manual of the MCU. I will thoroughly explain how to extract the maximum information from datasheets, Technical Reference manuals to configure and handle peripherals. These techniques you can go and apply to any MCUs you have at your hand.</p><p>In this course, I will walk you through step-by-step procedures on configuring various Peripherals like GPIOs, SPI, USART, I2C by taking you into the reference manual and datasheet. We will develop a fully working driver code, interrupt handlers, sample application everything from scratch to understand the big picture.</p><p>In each lecture, I assure you that you will learn something new to use in your work or projects. You'll find yourself handling these peripherals with much more clarity. You will be able to speculate and debug the problem quickly. I'll show you tricks and tips to debug the most common issues using debugging tools such as logic analyzers.</p><p><br></p><p>This is not the Arduino style of programming:</p><p>I believe Arduino is for quick prototyping of projects/products but not for mastering the working of micro-controllers and their peripherals. Unlike Arduino programming, where you develop a quick solution and prototyping of products using third-party libraries, this course is entirely different. In this course, no 3rd party libraries are used. Everything we will code by referring to the technical reference manual of the MCU and will create our own library. The Power of this approach is that you can quickly speculate problems and debug like a pro when things go wrong in your project due to bugs. If one thing me and my students are good at is \"debugging,.\" To achieve good debugging skills, it's essential to code by understanding how things work behind the scene but not by blindly using some third-party libraries, and that's the biggest TAKE away from this course.</p><p>The course is designed and explained so that it is generic across any microcontroller. The code we develop can be used as templates to quickly build a peripheral driver for your MCUs on-chip peripherals.</p><p><br></p><p>Software/Hardware used:</p><p>In this course, the code is developed so that it can be ported to any MCU you have at your hand. If you need any help porting these codes to different MCUs, you can always reach out to me! The course is strictly not bound to any 1 type of MCU. So, if you already have any Development board that runs with an ARM-Cortex M3/M4 processor, I recommend you continue using it. But if you don't have any development boards, then check out the below Development boards.</p><p><br></p><p>1. STM32F407xx based Discovery board ( This is the board used in this course)</p><p>MCU Vendor: STMicroelectronics</p><p><br></p><p>IDE: STM32CUBEIDE (Free)</p><p><br></p><p>My promise:</p><p>I am confident that this course will save you many hours of studying/experimenting/googling time to learn about MCU programming. I will personally answer your questions about this material, either privately or in a group discussion. If you are not satisfied, for any reason, you can get a full refund from Udemy within 30 days. No questions asked.<strong> </strong>But I am confident you won't need to. I stand behind this course 100% and am committed to helping you.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Learning order of FastBit Embedded Brain Academy Courses,</strong></p><p>If you are a beginner in the field of embedded systems, then you can take our courses in the below-mentioned order.</p><p>This is just a recommendation from the instructor for beginners.</p><p>1) Microcontroller Embedded C Programming: absolute beginners(Embedded C)</p><p>2) Embedded Systems Programming on ARM Cortex-M3/M4 Processor(ARM Cortex M4 Processor specific)</p><p>3) Mastering Microcontroller with Embedded Driver Development(MCU1)</p><p>4) Mastering Microcontroller: TIMERS, PWM, CAN, RTC,LOW POWER(MCU2)</p><p>5) Mastering Microcontroller: STM32-LTDC, LCD-TFT, LVGL(MCU3)</p><p>6) Embedded System Design using UML State Machines(State machine)</p><p>7) Mastering RTOS: Hands-on FreeRTOS and STM32Fx with Debugging(RTOS)</p><p>8) ARM Cortex M Microcontroller DMA Programming Demystified(DMA)</p><p>9) STM32Fx Microcontroller Custom Bootloader Development(Bootloader)</p><p>10) Embedded Linux Step by Step using Beaglebone Black(Linux)</p><p>11) Linux device driver programming using Beaglebone Black(LDD1)</p>",
